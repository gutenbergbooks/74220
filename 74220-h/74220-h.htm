<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>Very few words are needed here, for the book is meant to explain
its own scope. I have only to thank those to whose kindness I am
deeply indebted. Professor Buckland was so good as to help me when
I was striving to utilize the evidence of the Roman jurists. Chapter <span class="allsmcap">XLIX</span>
in particular owes much to his genial chastisement. On chapters <span class="allsmcap">II</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">LXI</span> Mr G G Coulton has given me most valuable criticism. Yet
I thank these gentlemen with some reluctance, fearing that I may
seem to connect their names with errors of my own. Mr T R Glover
kindly read chapter <span class="allsmcap">XXIX</span>. Professor Housman called my attention to
the ‘Farmer’s Law,’ and kindly lent me Mr Ashburner’s articles, to
which I have referred in Appendix B. To all these, and to the Syndics
of the University Press for undertaking the publication of this unconventional
work, I hereby express my sincere gratitude. My reasons
for adopting the method followed in this book are given on pages <a href="#Page_5">5-6</a>
and <a href="#Page_468">468</a>.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I">I. EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>The inquiry of which the results are set forth in these pages was undertaken
in the endeavour to satisfy my own mind on a very important
question in the history of the past. Circumstances have compelled me to
interest myself in the civilization of the Greco-Roman world. And it has
always been a painful disadvantage to students of the ‘classical’ systems
that the available record neither provides adequate labour-statistics nor
furnishes a criticism of existing labour-conditions from the point of view
of the handworkers. Accustomed as we are nowadays to continual
agitations for increase of wages and reduction of working hours, with
centuries of strange experience in the working of Poor-laws, we are in
no danger of undervaluing the importance of the wage-earner in our
social fabric. We are rather in danger of forgetting other (and perhaps
not less vital) considerations, under pressure of the material claims of
the labourer and his hire. Power goes by votes; the handworker is
now a voter; and the voice of the handworker is loud in the land. No
scheme is too wild to find advocates; and those who venture to assert
the right of invention, organization and thrift to superior recognition
as public benefits often think it necessary to adopt an apologetic tone.
Now it may be that this is a passing phase, and that the so-called
‘working-class’—that is, handworkers for wages—will come to see that
the civilization whose comforts they enjoy, and whose discomforts they
resent, does not wholly depend upon the simple repeated acts of the
handworkers themselves. Perhaps there are already signs of some such
reaction. But, if so, the reaction must be voluntary; for no power exists
in this country to constrain the handworker to take reasonable views,
in short to face facts. In these words I am not implying any denial of
the reasonableness of many of his claims. To offer an opinion on
questions of more or less is no business of mine.</p>

<p>But, when we compare modern industries in general with those of
the ancient world, we find ourselves in presence of a very different
situation. The largest scale of operations attainable in antiquity seems
small and crude by the side of recent achievements, for instance the
building of the Pyramids compared with the Panama canal. Machinery,
transport, and scientific discovery in general, have made it possible to
carry out colossal undertakings with comparative ease and without
wholesale destruction of human life. The greatest works of the ancients<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
are for the most part silent witnesses to the ruthless employment of
forced labour, either that of captives or bought slaves or that of the
impressed subjects of an autocrat. Mere brute force, applied in unlimited
quantity<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with callous indifference to the sufferings of the toilers,
was the chief means at disposal: mechanical invention had got so far
as to render possible some tasks that without it could not have been
performed at all. It gave extended effect to the mass of forced labour,
and there it stopped, for we have no reason to think that it improved
the labourer’s lot. The surviving evidence as to the condition<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of slaves
in mines and factories enables us to form some faint notion of the human
wastage resulting from the cruel forced-labour system. We may then
state the position briefly thus: to attempt great enterprises was only
possible through the crude employment of labour in great masses: the
supply of this labour was, or appeared to be, procurable only by compulsion:
and compulsion was operative through the institution of slavery
or the passive submission of cowed populations to the will of despots.
But if slavery promoted large-scale enterprise, surely large-scale enterprise
tended to establish slavery in the form of forced labour more
firmly than ever. In the modern world the necessity of employing free
labour has stimulated scientific invention, in mechanical and other
departments, the tendency of which is to require greater intellectual<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
development in the labourer, and in the long run to furnish him with
effective means of asserting his own freedom.</p>

<p>Under modern conditions, the gradual displacement of small handicraftsmen
by the growth of great capitalistic combinations is going
on, perhaps not always for good. The public accept this result as fate.
And, if economy in production and prime-cost cheapness are the only
things worth considering, it is not easy to condemn the process. But
events are steadily demonstrating the fear once entertained, that
handworkers in general would find their position weakened thereby,
to be groundless. If the independent craftsman has lost ground, the
wage-earning journeyman has gained. We need not follow out this
topic in detail, but note the contrast presented by the ancient world.
The ‘small man’ in crafts and trades was able to hold his own, for
without steam-power the capitalist was not strong enough to suppress
him. In a small way he was something of a capitalist himself, and
commonly owned slave-apprentices. His part in ancient civilization
was undoubtedly far more important than it appears in literature: for
he ministered to the ordinary needs of every day, while literature, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
as now and more than now, chiefly recorded the exceptional. When
we turn to the wage-earner, who earns a living by hiring out his bodily
powers to an employer, we are dealing with a wholly different class.
These are the free men who in a slave-holding society have to compete
with the slave. In the course of the present inquiry we must keep a
sharp look-out for every reference or allusion to such persons in the
department of agriculture, and in particular note numerous passages
in which the status of labourers cannot be inferred with certainty from
the language. But the importance of this special point is of course not
confined to agriculture.</p>

<p>I have chosen to limit my inquiry to the case of agriculture for these
reasons. First, because it was and is the industry on which human life,
and therefore all other industries and all progress, did and do rest.
Secondly, because its economic importance in the ancient world, so far
from declining, manifestly increased. The problem of food-supply was
always there. And it was never more pressing than in the later ages
of Rome, when imperial efforts to enforce production, if successful, fed
her barbarian armies, at the same time attracting the attention of barbarian
invaders to lands that promised the food-crops which they
themselves were too lazy to produce. Thirdly, because the importance
of agriculture was and is not merely economic. Its moral value, as a
nursery of steady citizens and, at need, of hardy soldiers, was and still
should be recognized by thoughtful men. Therefore its conditions
and its relative prosperity or decay deserve the attention of all historians
of all periods. Unluckily statistical record of a scientific
character is not available for the times that we call ancient, and numbers
are notoriously liable to corruption in manuscripts. Therefore I have
only ventured to give figures seldom and with reserve. For agriculture
we have nothing on the scale of the inscriptions that record wages, for
instance on public works at Athens. On the other hand we have for
certain periods the evidence of specialists such as Cato, Varro and
Columella, to whom we owe much information as to the actual or
possible conditions of rustic enterprise and labour. The relation of
agriculture and agricultural labour to the state as a whole is a subject
illustrated by great theorists such as Plato and Aristotle. The practical
problems of landowning and farming meet us now and then in the
contemporary evidence of such men as Xenophon and the younger
Pliny. Even orators, though necessarily partisan witnesses, at times
give valuable help: they may distort facts, but it is not their interest
to lessen their own power of persuasion by asserting what is manifestly
incredible. The ancient historians tell us very little, even of the past;
contemporary evidence from them is especially rare. They are preoccupied
with public affairs, and the conditions of rustic life and labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
only concern them at moments when serious distress or disorder
compels attention. Rhetoricians and poets are doubtful witnesses.
Like the orators, they use their matter freely and with much colouring
for their immediate purposes. But they are not, like forensic orators,
in direct contact with practical emergencies. The questions arising out
of Vergil’s <i>Georgics</i> are problems to be discussed by themselves.</p>

<p>The contribution of encyclopaedic or occasional writers is in some
cases of value. I will here only name the elder Pliny and Apuleius.
Books of travel and geography, for instance Herodotus and Strabo,
give stray details, but generally in reference to distant countries, mostly
in the East and so hardly within my subject, save for purposes of comparison.
There are however two topics with which I am not directly
concerned, but which it is impossible wholly to ignore in speaking of
ancient agriculture. First, the relation of military duty to landholding
[the farmer as citizen soldier], and mercenary service [the rustic as
volunteer for pay]. This has been so fully treated in modern handbooks
that I need say little about it. Secondly, the various conditions
of tenure of land. That rustic life and therewith rustic labour were
directly and deeply affected by varieties of tenure, needs no proof. The
cited opinions of Roman lawyers in the Digest are the main authority
on points of this kind, and stray references elsewhere serve to illustrate
them. In conclusion I have only to insist again on the fact that we
have no direct witness of the labourer’s, or even the working farmer’s,
point of view. The evidence all comes from above; and therefore
generally gives us a picture of conditions as the law meant them to be
and presumed them normally to be. How far the practical working
corresponded to the legal position, is only to be guessed with caution
from the admissions involved in the elaboration of legal remedies; and,
in the case of imperial <i>coloni</i>, from the unique evidence of the notable
African inscriptions.</p>

<p>It is I trust after the above considerations not unreasonable to
devote no special chapters to certain writers whom nevertheless it is
often necessary to cite in notes. Diodorus, Livy, Athenaeus, Macrobius,
Gellius, Palladius, are cases of the kind. Stray references in their works
are valuable, but there is nothing to require a treatment of them as
several wholes. Even Livy is chiefly useful as handing down remains
of past tradition: hence he (and Dionysius and Plutarch with him)
have a leading place in the introductory chapter on <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">early Rome</a>. So
too the writers of the so-called <i>historia Augusta</i> and the laws of
the Theodosian and Justinian Codes find their place in the notes to
certain chapters. On the other hand (to omit obvious cases) Euripides,
Xenophon, the younger Seneca, Martial, the younger Pliny, Apuleius,
Ammianus, Symmachus, Apollinaris Sidonius, need careful treatment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
with full regard to the periods and circumstances by which their
evidential values are severally qualified. And in order to place each
witness in his proper setting it is sometimes necessary to pause and
group a number of circumstances together in a special chapter. This
arises from the endeavour to preserve so far as possible the thread of
continuity, which is always really there, though at times very thin,
owing to the loss of many works in the course of ages. In such
chapters one has to look both backward and forward, and often to
digress for a moment on topics only connected indirectly with the
main object.</p>

<p>I have tried to avoid needless repetitions, but some repetitions are
unavoidable, since the same point often serves to illustrate different
parts of the argument. To make a system of cross-references from
chapter to chapter quite complete is hardly possible, and would add
immensely to the bulk of footnotes. It has seemed better to attempt
completeness by elaboration of the Index. A few details from a period
later than that with which I am concerned are given in the Appendix,
as being of interest. Also the names of some books from which in a
course of miscellaneous reading I have derived more or less help, particularly
in noting modern survivals or analogies. For significant
matter occurs in quite unexpected quarters. And the observers who
record facts of rustic life and labour in Italy or France, in North or
Central or South America, without attempting to manipulate them in
connexion with a theory, deserve much gratitude.</p>

<p>It is evident that in the handling of evidence there is room for
some variety of method. And it seems reasonable to hold that the
choice of method should be mainly guided by two leading considerations,
the nature of the evidence available and the aim of the inquiry
pursued. In the present case the inquiry deals with a part, a somewhat
neglected part, of Greco-Roman history: and the subject is one that
can by no means be strictly confined to ascertaining the bare facts of
farm life and labour. That the conditions of agriculture were not only
important in connexion with food-supply, but had an extensive moral
and political bearing, is surely beyond dispute. And the nature of the
surviving evidence favours, or rather requires, the taking of a correspondingly
wide view. Outside the circle of technical writings, the
literary evidence almost always has an eye to the position of agriculture
as related to the common weal; nor is this point of view ignored even
by the technical writers. Therefore, in treating the subject as I have
tried to treat it, it is very necessary to take each witness separately so
far as possible, and not to appraise the value of his testimony without
a fair consideration of his condition and environment. This necessity
is peculiarly obvious in the case of the theorists, whose witness is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
instructive in a very high degree, but only when we bear in mind the
existing state of things from observation of which their conclusions
were derived. And the changes of attitude in philosophic thought are
sometimes highly instructive. Take farm life and labour as it appears
to Plato and Aristotle and later to Musonius: a whole volume of
history, economic moral and political, lies in the interval of some
400 years. Inscriptions furnish little to the student of this subject, but
that little is worth having. To conclude this paragraph, I do not
apologize for putting my authorities in the witness-box and questioning
them one by one. For only thus do I see a possibility of giving a true
picture of the conditions with which I am concerned. It is a long
method, but perhaps not uninteresting, and I see no other.</p>

<p>It may seem necessary to explain why I have not devoted special
chapters to rustic life and labour in Oriental countries, some of which
eventually became parts of the Roman empire. Such countries are for
instance Egypt, Palestine and Syria. One reason is that I could do
nothing more than compile conclusions of the inquirers who have lately
rescued a vast mass of detail, chiefly from the Egyptian papyri. Age
forbade me to undertake this task unless it seemed clear that my
inquiry really depended on it. But, inasmuch as I have not been trying
to produce a technical treatise upon ancient agriculture, I do not think
it necessary. That there is room for such a treatise, I have no doubt:
nor that its writer will need to have many years at his disposal and a good
knowledge of several sciences at his back. With regard to eastern
countries other than Egypt, practically the Seleucid empire, knowledge
is at present very scanty, as Rostowzew has to confess. Ancient India
lies quite beyond my range, as having never been a part of the Roman
empire: but there is evidently much of interest to be gathered in this
field. From these extensive and promising researches my limited effort
is divided by a clearly marked line. I am concerned with agriculture
and agricultural labour not as the occupation of passive populations
merely producing so much food year by year, peoples over whom
centuries might pass without ascertainable change of a moral social or
political character. Such peoples, in short, as do not get beyond the
conception of ruler and ruled to that of state and citizen, or at least have
not yet done so. For of all conclusions to be drawn from the history
of the Greco-Roman world none seems to me more certain than the
fact that, while political social and moral movements affected the conditions
of agriculture, agricultural changes reacted upon political social
and moral conditions. Thus the general history of the peoples, comprising
the rise and fall of ancient efforts towards self-government,
must always be kept in view: the fluctuations of what I may call civic
values, and the position of farmers as labourers or employers of labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
cannot be treated in separate compartments and their reciprocal effect
ignored. That in the later stages of my inquiry Oriental influences
begin to dominate Roman imperial policy, is evident, and I have not
left this factor out of account. But this phenomenon announces the
end of the old world. The long struggle of the Empire in the East and
its final overthrow by the forces of Islam, its break-up in the West and
the foundation of new nation-states, are beyond my range. In the
<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a> I have put some remarks on two documents of the Byzantine
period, from which we get glimpses of changes that were proceeding
in the eastern empire while it still held its ground and was indeed the
most highly organized of existing powers. To these I have subjoined
a list of some of the books I have consulted and found helpful in various
degrees, particularly such as have furnished modern illustrations in the
way of analogy or survival. A few special quotations from some of
these may serve to shew how very striking such illustrations can be.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">II. LAND AND LABOUR.</h3>

<p>Of the many difficult questions connected with the past history of
the human race few have evoked such a difference of opinion as the
practical importance of slavery. By some inquirers it has been held
that the so-called ‘classical’ civilization of the Greco-Roman world
rested upon a slavery basis, in short that slavery alone enabled that
civilization to follow the lines of its actual development. In reply to
this doctrine it is urged<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that its holders have been led astray by an
unhistorical method. They have been deeply impressed by the all-pervading
evils of the economic and domestic slave-system during the
period (say 200 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>-200 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> roughly) when it was in full extension
and vigour. The prepossession thus created has led them to misinterpret
the phenomena of earlier ages, and to ignore the significance of the
later period of decline. Prejudiced eyes have detected slavery where
it was not, and have seen in it where existent an importance greater
than impartial inquiry will justify. Moreover the discussion of slavery-questions
in modern times, conducted with the intemperate warmth of
partisan controversy, have had an influence unfavourable to the statement
of facts in their true relations, and therefore to the exercise of
cool judgment. According to this view the facts of our record shew
that, while slave-labour had its four centuries or so of predominance,
free-labour never ceased, and on it, and not on slavery, the civilization
of the ‘classical’ world was built up. It is argued that in primitive conditions
there was little slavery, that growth of trade and exchange (and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
therewith of civilization) led to division of labour and the growth of
larger enterprises. On this follows a time in which the employment
of slave-labour becomes more and more common, and ends by being
for some centuries the basis of economic and domestic life. In due
course comes the period of decline, when for various reasons slaves
became less numerous, and the highly-organized civilization of antiquity
relapses into the primitive conditions of the early Middle Age. Slavery
is not extinct, but reverts generally to various degrees of serfdom,
resembling that which meets us in the early traditions of Greek slavery.
Things have gone round the full circle, and the world takes a fresh
start.</p>

<p>This version of the process is attractive. It presents to us a spectacle
of cyclic movement, pleasing from its simplicity and dignity. But it
seems to imply that the old civilization reached its height more or less
concurrently with the growth of slavery. One is driven to ask<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> whether
the concurrence was purely accidental or not. So far as concerns the
manufacture of articles for export by slave-industry, it can hardly have
been a mere chance: nor is it denied that in this department it was
the demand created by the needs of growing civilization that called
forth the supply. Luxury too is merely a name for such needs when
they clearly exceed strict necessaries of life: and here too the monstrous
extravagancies of domestic slavery were a characteristic feature of the
civilization of the Greco-Roman world. That neither of these forms of
servile employment could outlive the civilization that had produced
them, is surely no wonder. The case of slavery in agriculture is less
simple, and several questions may suggest themselves to anyone who
considers this subject with an open mind.</p>

<p>Agriculture was long regarded, from a social point of view, as
superior to other occupations dependent on bodily labour. This
opinion dated from very early times when, as traditions agree, the land
was owned by privileged nobles who as members of powerful clans
formed aristocracies of a more or less military character. War was
waged by men fighting hand to hand, and it was natural that handwork
of a kind likely to promote health and strength should be
honoured above manual trades of a less invigorating and even sedentary
character. The development of cities and urban life, which in many
states led to the overthrow of the old clan aristocracies, did not make
handicraftsmen the equals of agriculturists in popular esteem. Pressure
to win a firm footing on the land was as marked a feature in Athenian
Attica as in Roman Latium. Agriculture was a profession worthy of
the free citizen, and the ownership of a plot of land stamped the
citizen as a loyal and responsible member of a free and self-conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
community. The ruin of Attic farmers in the Peloponnesian war, the
disastrous changes in Italian agriculture after Rome became imperial,
still left the old prepossession. The charm of country life and pursuits
remained as an ineffective ideal. Greek philosophers were impressed
with the virtues of farmer-folk, virtues social moral and ultimately
political. From them Cicero and others learnt to praise rustic life:
the Gracchi made vain efforts to revive it: the poets, led by Vergil,
pictured the glories of old Italian agriculture: but the aspirations
were vain. The ‘classical’ civilization was urban in its growth, and
urban it remained. Writers on agriculture might lament that free
men, capable of tilling the land, loitered idly in the city. In practice
they had to take facts as they found them, and give elaborate precepts
for a farm-system in which slavery was the essential factor.</p>

<p>It was and is possible to regard agriculture from various points of
view. Three of these at least deserve a preliminary consideration. The
nakedly economic view, that the production of food is necessary for
any life above that of mere savages, and therefore is worthy of respect,
can never have been wholly absent from men’s minds in any age. It
was common property, and found frequent expression. Even when
various causes led to much dependence on imported corn, the sentiment
still survived, and its soundness was recognized by philosophers.
The military view, that the hardy peasant makes the best soldier, was
generally accepted in principle, but its relation to agriculture in the
strict sense of tillage was not always a direct one. The technical
training of skilled combatants began early in Greece. It was not only
in the Spartan or Cretan systems that such training was normal: the
citizen armies of Athens consisted of men who had passed through a
long course of gymnastic exercises and drill. During their training
these young men can hardly have devoted much labour to the tillage
of farms, even those of them who were of country birth. What percentage
of them settled down in their later years to farm-life, is just
what one vainly wishes to know. The helot-system supplied the tillage
that fed the warrior-caste of Sparta. It would seem that the toils of
hunting played a great part in producing the military fitness required
of the young Spartiate. We may be pretty sure that the Thessalian
cavalry—wealthy lords ruling dependent cultivators—were not tillers
of the soil. Boeotia and Arcadia were both lands in which there was
a large farmer class. Boeotian infantry were notable for their steadiness
in the shock of battle. But they were not untrained, far from it.
United action was ever difficult in Arcadia, where small cities lay
scattered in the folds of mountains. Hence no Arcadian League ever
played a leading part in Greece. But the rustics of these country towns
and villages were man for man as good material for war-work as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Greece could produce. In the later age of professional soldering they,
with the Aetolians and others in the less civilized parts, furnished
numbers of recruits to the Greek mercenary armies. But the regular
mercenary who had the luck to retire in comfortable circumstances,
on savings of pay and loot, is portrayed to us as more inclined to
luxury and wantonness in some great city than to the simple monotony
of rustic life. Nor must we forget that slaves were often an important
part<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of war-booty, and that the professional warrior was used to the
attendance of slaves (male and female) even on campaigns. So far the
connexion of peasant and soldier does not amount to much more than
the admission that the former was a type of man able to endure the
hardships of a military career.</p>

<p>The national regular army formed by Philip son of Amyntas in
Macedonia, afterwards the backbone of Alexander’s mixed host, is in
itself a phenomenon of great interest: for in making it Philip made a
nation. That the ranks were mainly filled with country folk is certain.
But, what with wastage in wars and the settlement of many old
soldiers in the East, there is little evidence to shew whether any considerable
number of veterans returned to Macedon and settled on the
land. I believe that such cases were few. The endless wars waged by
Alexander’s successors with mixed and mongrel armies were hardly
favourable to rustic pursuits: foundation of great new cities was the
characteristic of the times. When we turn to Rome we find a very
different story. Tradition represents landowners settled on the land
and tilling it as the persons responsible for the defence of the state.
Cincinnatus called from the plough to be dictator is the typical figure
of early patriotic legend. When the Roman Plebeians dislodged the
Patrician clans from their monopoly of political power, the burden of
military service still rested on the <i>adsidui</i>, the men with a footing on
the land. Tradition still shews us the farmer-soldier taking the risk
of disaster to his homestead during his absence on campaigns. In the
historical twilight of fragmentary details, coloured by later imagination,
thus much is clear and credible. The connexion between landholding
and soldiering was not openly disregarded until the reforms
of Marius. The age of revolution was then already begun, and one of
its most striking features was the creation of a professional soldiery, a
force which, as experience proved, was more easy to raise than to disband.
The method of pensioning veterans by assigning to them parcels
of land for settlement was in general a failure, for the men were
unused to thrift and indisposed to a life of patient and uneventful
labour. The problem of the Republic was inherited by the Empire,
and attempts at solution were only partially successful: but the system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
of standing armies, posted on the frontiers, made the settlement of
veterans in border-provinces a matter of less difficulty. From the
third century <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> onwards we find a new plan coming into use. Men
were settled with their families on lands near the frontiers, holding
them by a military tenure which imposed hereditary liability to service
in the armies. Thus the difficulty was for a time met by approaching
it from the other end. The superiority of the rustic recruit was as
fully recognized as ever: at the end of the fourth century it was reaffirmed<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
by Vegetius.</p>

<p>I pass on to the third point of view, which I may perhaps call
philosophic. It appears in practice as the view of the statesman, in
theory as that of the speculative philosopher. Men whose life and
interests are bound up with agriculture are in general a steady class,
little inclined to wild agitations and rash ventures. On a farm there
is always something not to be left undone without risk of loss. The
operations of nature go on unceasingly, uncontrolled by man. Man
must adapt himself to the conditions of soil and weather: hence he
must be ever on the watch to take advantage of his opportunities, and
this leaves him scant leisure for politics. We may add that the habit
of conforming to nature’s laws, and of profiting by not resisting what
cannot be successfully resisted, is a perpetual education in patience.
Working farmers as a class were not men lightly to embark in revolutionary
schemes, so long as their condition was at all tolerable. It
must be borne in mind that before the invention of representative
systems a citizen could only vote by appearing in person at the city,
where all the Assemblies were held. Assemblies might be adjourned,
and two journeys, to the city and back, were not only time-wasting
and tiresome, but might have to be repeated. Accordingly we hear of
the encouragement of Attic farmers by Peisistratus<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> as being a policy
designed to promote the stability of his government. At Rome we
find reformers alarmed at the decay of the farmer-class in a great part
of Italy, and straining to revive it as the sound basis of a national life,
the only practical means of purifying the corrupted institutions of the
state. Selfish opposition on the part of those interested in corruption
was too strong for reformers, and the chance of building up a true
Italian nation passed away. The working farmer had disappeared
from Roman politics. The swords and the venal city mob remained,
and the later literature was left to deplore the consequences.</p>

<p>The course of agricultural decline in Greece was different in detail
from that in Italy, but its evil effects on political life were early
noted, at least in Attica. The rationalist Euripides saw the danger
clearly, during the Peloponnesian war; and the sympathy of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
conservative Aristophanes with the suffering farmers was plainly
marked. The merits of the farmer-class as ‘safe’ citizens, the backbone
of a wise and durable state-life, became almost a commonplace
of Greek political theory. Plato and Aristotle might dream of ideal
states, governed by skilled specialists professionally trained for their
career from boyhood. In their more practical moments, turning
from aspirations to facts of the world around them, they confessed
the political value of the farmer-class. To Aristotle the best hope of
making democracy a wholesome and tolerable form of government lay
in the strengthening of this element: the best Demos is the γεωργικὸς
δῆμος, and it is a pity that it so often becomes superseded by the
growing population devoted to trades and commerce. I need not
carry further these brief and imperfect outlines of the honourable
opinion held of agriculture in the Greco-Roman world. As producing
necessary food, as rearing hardy soldiers, as favouring the growth and
maintenance of civic virtues, it was the subject of general praise. Some
might confess that they shrank from personal labour on the land. Yet
even in Caesarian Rome it is somewhat startling when Sallust<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> dismisses
farming in a few words of cynical contempt.</p>

<p>It is clear that the respect felt for agriculture was largely due to
the opinion that valuable qualities of body and mind were closely connected
with its practice and strengthened thereby. So long as it was
on the primitive footing, each household finding labour for its own
maintenance, the separation of handwork and direction could hardly
arise. This primitive state of things, assumed by theorists ancient
and modern, and depicted in tradition, had ceased to be normal in the
time of our earliest records. And the employment of persons, not
members of the household, as hired labourers, or of bondmen only
connected with the house as dependents, at once differentiated these
‘hands’ from the master and his family. The master could not habitually
hire day-labourers or keep a slave unless he found it paid him to do so.
For a man to work for his own profit or for that of another were very
different things. This simple truism, however, does not end the matter
from my present point of view. It is necessary to ask whether the respect
felt for agriculture was so extended as to include the hired
labourer and the slave as well as the working master. We shall see
that it was not. The house-master, holding and cultivating a plot of
land on a secure tenure, is the figure glorified in traditions and
legendary scenes. The Greek term αὐτουργός, the man who does his
own work, is specially applied to him as a man that works with his
own hands. It crops up in literature often, from Euripides to Polybius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and Dion Chrysostom; and sometimes, when the word is not used, it
is represented by equivalents. But both the hired labourer and the
slave were employed for the express purpose of working with their own
hands. And yet, so far as agriculture is concerned, I cannot find that
they were credited with αὐτουργία, the connotation<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of which is generally
favourable, seldom neutral, never (I think) unfavourable. It seems then
that the figure present to the mind was one who not only worked with
his own hands, but worked for his own profit—that is, on his own
farm. And with this interpretation the traditions of early Rome fully
agree.</p>

<p>To admit this does not however imply that the working house-master
employed neither hired labourer nor slave. So long as he took
a hand in the farm-work, he was a working cultivator for his own profit.
The larger the scale of his holding, the more he would need extra
labour. If prosperous, he would be able to increase his holding or supplement
his farming<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> by other enterprises. More and more he would
be tempted to drop handwork and devote himself to direction. If still
successful, he might move on a stage further, living in the city and
carrying on his farms by deputy, employing stewards, hired freemen
or slaves, or freedmen, his former slaves. If he found in the city more
remunerative pursuits than agriculture, he might sell his land and the
live and dead stock thereon, and become simply an urban capitalist.
So far as I know, this last step was very seldom taken; and I believe
the restraining influence to have been the prestige attached to the
ownership of land, even when civic franchises had ceased to depend on
the possession of that form of property alone. If this view be correct,
the fact is notable: for the system of great landed estates, managed
by stewards<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> on behalf of wealthy owners who lived in the city, was
the ruin of the peasant farmer class, in whose qualities statesmen and
philosophers saw the guarantee for the state’s lasting vigour. No longer
were αὐτουργοὶ a force in politics: in military service the professional
soldier, idling in the intervals of wars, superseded the rustic, levied for
a campaign and looking forward to the hour of returning to his plough.
It was in Italy that the consummation of this change was most marked,
for Rome alone provided a centre in which the great landlord could
reside and influence political action in his own interest. To Rome the
wealth extorted from tributary subjects flowed in an ever-swelling
stream. No small part of the spoils served to enrich the noble landlords,
directly or indirectly, and to supply them with the funds needed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
for corrupting the city mob and so controlling politics. Many could
afford to hold their lands even when it was doubtful whether estates
managed by slaves or hirelings were in fact a remunerative investment.
If we may believe Cicero, it was financial inability<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to continue this
extravagant policy that drove some men of apparent wealth to favour
revolutionary schemes. The old-fashioned farmstead, the <i>villa</i>, was
modernized into a luxurious country seat, in which the owner might
now and then pass a brief recess, attended by his domestic slaves
from Town, and perhaps ostentatiously entertaining a party of
fashionable friends.</p>

<p>We have followed the sinister progress of what I will call the
Agricultural Interest, from the ‘horny-handed’ peasant<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> farmer to the
land-proud capitalist. No doubt the picture is a highly coloured one,
but in its general outlines we are not entitled to question its truth.
Exceptions there certainly were. In hilly parts of Italy a rustic population<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
of freemen survived, and it was from them that the jobbing
gangs of wage-earners of whom we read were drawn. And in the great
plain of the Po agricultural conditions remained far more satisfactory
than in such districts as Etruria or Lucania, where great estates were
common. A genuine farming population seems there to have held
most of the land, and rustic slavery appeared in less revolting form.
But these exceptions did not avail to stay the decline of rural Italy.
True, as the supply of slave-labour gradually shrank in the empire,
the working farmer reappeared on the land. But he reappeared as a
tenant gradually becoming bound<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to the soil, worried by the exactions
of officials, or liable to a blood-tax in the shape of military service. He
was becoming not a free citizen of a free state, but a half-free serf
helplessly involved in a great mechanical system. Such a person bore
little resemblance to the free farmer working with his own hands for
himself on his own land, the rustic figure from whom we started. On
the military side, he was, if a soldier, now soldier first and farmer
afterwards: on the civic side, he was a mere subject-unit, whose virtues
were of no political importance and commanded no respect. In the
final stage we find the government recruiting its armies from barbarians
and concerned to keep the farmer on the land. So cogent then was
the necessity of insuring the supply of food for the empire and its
armies.</p>

<p>At this point we must return to our first question, how far the agriculture
of the Greco-Roman world depended on free or slave labour. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
is clear that, while the presence of the slave presupposes the freeman
to control him, the presence of the freeman does not necessarily imply
that of the slave. Dion Chrysostom<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was logically justified in saying
that freedom comes before slavery in order of time. And no doubt
this is true so long as we only contemplate the primitive condition of
households each providing for its own vital needs by the labour of its
members. But the growth of what we call civilization springs from the
extension of needs beyond the limits of what is absolutely necessary
for human existence. By what steps the advantages of division of
labour were actually discovered is a subject for the reconstructive
theorist. But it must have been observed at a very early stage that
one man’s labour might be to another man’s profit. Those who tamed
and employed other animals were not likely to ignore the possibilities
offered by the extension of the system to their brother men. It would
seem the most natural thing in the world. It might be on a very small
scale, and any reluctance on the bondsman’s part might be lessened by
the compensations of food and protection. A powerful master might
gather round him a number of such dependent beings, and he had
nothing to gain by treating them cruelly. On them he could devolve
the labour of producing food, and so set free his own kinsmen to assert
the power of their house. In an age of conflict stronger units tended
to absorb weaker, and the formation of larger societies would tend to
create fresh needs, to encourage the division of labour, and to promote
civilization by the process of exchange. Labour under assured control
was likely to prove an economic asset of increasing value. In agriculture
it would be of special importance as providing food for warriors
busied with serving the community in war.</p>

<p>This imaginative sketch may serve to remind us that there are two
questions open to discussion in relation to the subject. First, the
purely speculative one, whether the early stages of progress in civilization
could have been passed without the help of slavery. Second, the
question of fact, whether they were so passed or not. It is the latter
with which I am concerned. The defects of the evidence on which we
have to form an opinion are manifest. Much of it is not at first hand,
and it will often be necessary to comment on its unsatisfactory character.
In proceeding to set it out in detail, I must again repeat that two
classes of free handworkers must be clearly kept distinct—those who
work for themselves, and those who work for others. It is the latter
class only that properly come into comparison with slaves. A man
habitually working for himself may of course work occasionally for
others as a wage-earner. But here, as in the case of the farmer-soldier,
we have one person in two capacities.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">III. THE HOMERIC POEMS.</h3>

<p><b>The Iliad.</b> In a great war-poem we can hardly expect to find many
references to the economic labours of peace. And an army fighting far
from home in a foreign land would naturally be out of touch with the
rustic life of Greece. Nor was the poet concerned to offer us the details
of supply-service, though he represents the commissariat as efficient.
Free labour appears<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in various forms of handicraft, and the mention
of pay (μισθός)<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> shews wage-earning as a recognized fact. We hear of
serving for hire (θητεύειν)<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, and the ἔριθοι or farm-labourers<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> seem to
be θῆτες under a special name. That labour is not viewed as a great
degradation may fairly be inferred from the case of Hephaestus the
smith-god, from the wage-service of Poseidon and Apollo under Laomedon,
and from the herdsman-service of Apollo under Admetus.
Agriculture is assumed, and in the Catalogue ‘works’ (ἔργα)<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> occurs in
the sense of ‘tilled lands.’ But it is chiefly in similes or idyllic scenes
that we get glimpses of farming<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> operations. Thus we have ploughing,
reaping, binding, threshing, winnowing. Most striking of all is the
passage in which the work of irrigation<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> is graphically described. There
is no reason to suppose that any of the workers in these scenes are
slaves: they would seem to be wage-earners. But I must admit that,
if slaves were employed under the free workers, the poet would very
likely not mention such a detail: that is, if slavery were a normal institution
taken for granted. For the present I assume only free labour
in these cases. We are made aware of a clear social difference between
the rich and powerful employer and the employed labourer. The
mowers are at work in the field of some rich man<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> (ἀνδρὸς μάκαρος κατ’
ἄρουραν), who does not appear to lend a hand himself. Or again in the
close of a ruler (τέμενος βασιλήιον)<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, with binders following them, a
busy scene. The βασιλεὺς himself stands watching them in dignified
silence, staff in hand. There is nothing here to suggest that the small
working farmer was a typical figure in the portraiture of rural life.
Flocks and herds are of great importance, indeed the ox is a normal
standard of value. But the herdsmen are mean freemen. Achilles is
disgusted<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> at the prospect of being drowned by Scamander ‘like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
young swineherd swept away by a stream in flood.’ For the heroes
of the poem are warrior-lords: the humble toilers of daily life are of
no account beside them.</p>

<p>And yet the fact of slavery stands out clearly, and also its connexion
with the fact of capture in war. The normal way of dealing
with enemies is to slay the men and enslave the women. The wife of
a great warrior has many handmaidens, captives of her lord’s prowess.
A slave-trade exists, and we hear of males being spared<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and ‘sold
abroad’: for they are sent ‘to islands far away’ or ‘beyond the salt sea.’
We do not find male slaves with the army: perhaps we may guess
that they were not wanted. A single reference to δμῶες (properly slave-captives)
appears in <span class="allsmcap">XIX</span> 333, where Achilles, speaking of his property
at home in Phthia, says κτῆσιν ἐμὴν δμῶάς τε. But we cannot be certain
that these slaves are farm-hands. We can only reflect that a slave
bought and paid for was not likely to be fed in idleness or put to
the lightest work. In general it seems that what weighed upon the
slave, male or female, was the pressure of constraint, the loss of freedom,
not the fear of cruel treatment. What Hector keeps from the Trojans<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
is the ‘day of constraint,’ ἦμαρ ἀναγκαῖον, also expressed by δούλιον
ἦμαρ. Viewed from the other side we find enslavement consisting in
a taking away<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the ‘day of freedom,’ ἐλεύθερον ἦμαρ. The words δούλην
<span class="allsmcap">III</span> 409 and ἀνδραπόδεσσι <span class="allsmcap">VII</span> 475 are isolated cases of substantives in
passages the genuineness of which has been questioned. On the whole
it is I think not an unfair guess that, if the poet had been depicting the
life of this same Greek society in their homeland, and not under conditions
of present war, we should have found more references to slavery
as a working institution. As it is, we get a momentary glimpse<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of
neighbour landowners, evidently on a small scale, engaged in a dispute
concerning their boundaries, measuring-rod in hand; and nothing to
shew whether such persons supplied the whole of their own labour in
tillage or supplemented it by employing hired men or slaves.</p>

<p><b>The Odyssey</b> is generally held to be of later date than the Iliad.
A far more important distinction is that its scenes are not episodes of
war. A curious difference of terms<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is seen in the case of the word
οἰκῆες, which in the Iliad seems to mean ‘house-folk’ including both
free and slave, in the Odyssey to mean slaves only. But as to the condition
of slaves there is practically no difference. A conquered foe was
spared on the battlefield by grace of the conqueror, whose ownership
of his slave was unlimited: and this unlimited right could be conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
by sale<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to a third party. We find Odysseus ready to consign offending
slaves<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
    to torture mutilation or death. In the story of his visit to Troy<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
as a spy we hear that he passed for a slave, and that part of his disguise
consisted in the marks of flogging. Yet the relations of master and
mistress to their slaves are most kindly in ordinary circumstances.
The faithful slave is a type glorified in the Odyssey: loyalty is the first
virtue of a slave, and it is disloyalty, however shewn, that justifies the
master’s vengeance. For they live on intimate terms<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> with their master
and mistress and are trusted to a wonderful degree. In short we may
say that the social atmosphere of the Odyssey is full of mild slavery,
but that in the background there is always the grim possibility of
atrocities committed by absolute power. And we have a trace even of
secondary<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> slavery: for the swineherd, himself a slave, has an under-slave
of his own, bought with his own goods from slave-dealers while
his own master was abroad. Naturally enough we find slaves classed
as a part of the lord’s estate. Odysseus hopes<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> that before he dies he
may set eyes on his property, his slaves and his lofty mansion. But
another and perhaps socially more marked distinction seems implied
in the suitors’ question<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> about Telemachus—‘who were the lads that
went with him on his journey? were they young nobles of Ithaca, or
his own hired men and slaves (θῆτές τε δμῶές τε)?’ The answer is that
they were ‘the pick of the community, present company excepted.’
The wage-earner and the slave do not seem to be parted by any broad
social line. Indeed civilization had a long road yet to travel before
levelling movement among the free classes drew a vital distinction
between them on the one side and slaves on the other.</p>

<p>Free workers of various kinds are often referred to, and we are,
owing to the circumstances of the story, brought more into touch with
them than in the Iliad. Handicraftsmen<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> are a part of the life of the
time, and we must assume the smith the carpenter and the rest of the
males to be free: female slaves skilled in working wool do not justify
us in supposing that the corresponding men are slaves. Beside these
are other men who practise a trade useful to the community, ‘public-workers’
(δημιοεργοί)<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, but not necessarily handworkers. Thus we find
the seer, the leech, the bard, classed with the carpenter as persons whom
all men would readily entertain as guests; the wandering beggar none
would invite. The last is a type of ‘mean freeman,’ evidently common
in that society. He is too much akin to the suppliant, whom religion<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
protects, to be roughly shewn the door: he is αἰδοῖος ἀλήτης<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, and trades
on the reverence felt for one who appeals as stranger to hospitable
custom. Thus he picks up a living<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> from the scraps and offals of great
houses. But he is despised, and, what concerns us here, despised<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> not
only for his abject poverty but for his aversion to honest work. That
the poet admires industry is clear, and is curiously illustrated by his
contrasted pictures of civilization and barbarism. In Phaeacia are the
fenced-in gardens<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> that supply Alcinous and his people with never-failing
fruits: the excellence of their naval craftsmen is expressed in
the ‘yarn’ of ships that navigate themselves. In the land of the
Cyclopes, nature provides<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> them with corn and wine, but they neither
sow nor plough. They have flocks of sheep and goats. They have no
ships or men to build them. They live in caves, isolated savages with
no rudiments of civil life. It is not too much to say that the poet is a
believer in work and a contemner of idleness: the presence of slaves
does not suggest that the free man is to be lazy. Odysseus boasts of
his activities (δρηστοσύνη)<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. He is ready to split wood and lay a fire,
to prepare and serve a meal, and in short to wait on the insolent suitors
as inferiors do on nobles. Of course he is still the unknown wanderer:
but the contrast<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> between him and the genuine beggar Irus is an effective
piece of by-play in the poem.</p>

<p>Turning to agriculture, we may note that it fills no small place.
Wheat and barley, pounded or ground to meal, seem to furnish the
basis of civilized diet. The Cyclops<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> does not look like a ‘bread-eating
man,’ and wine completely upsets him to his ruin. Evidently the
bounty of nature has been wasted on such a savage. But the cultivation
of cereal crops is rather assumed than emphasized in the pictures of
Greek life. We hear of tilled lands (ἔργα)<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, and farm-labour (ἔργον)<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
    is
mentioned as too wearisome for a high-spirited warrior noble. The tired
and hungry plowman<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> appears in a simile. But the favourite culture
is that of the vine and olive and other fruits in orchards carefully fenced
and tended. One of the suitors makes a jesting offer<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to the unknown
Odysseus ‘Stranger, would you be willing to serve for hire (θητευέμεν),
if I took you on, in an outlying field—you shall have a sufficient wage—gathering
stuff for fences and planting tall trees? I would see that
you were regularly fed clothed and shod. No, you are a ne’er-do-weel
(ἔργα κάκ’ ἔμμαθες) and will not do farm-work (ἔργον): you prefer to go
round cringing for food to fill your insatiate belly.’ This scornful proposal
sets the noble’s contempt for wage-earning labour in a clear light.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
And the shade of Achilles, repudiating<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the suggestion that it is a great
thing to be a ruler among the dead in the ghostly world, says ‘I had
rather be one bound to the soil, serving another for hire, employed by
some landless man of little property, than be king of all the dead.’ He
is speaking strongly: to work for hire, a mean destiny at best, is at its
meanest when the employer is a man with no land-lot of his own
(ἄκληρος), presumably occupying on precarious tenure a bit of some
lord’s estate. After such utterances we cannot wonder that as we saw
above, θῆτες and δμῶες are mentioned<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in the same breath.</p>

<p>That slaves are employed on the farm is clear enough. When
Penelope sends for old Dolius<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, a <i>servus dotalis</i> of hers (to use the
Roman expression) she adds ‘who is in charge of my fruit-garden,’ So
too the aged Laertes, living a hard life on his farm, has a staff of slaves<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
to do his will, and their quarters and farm duties are a marked detail
of the picture. The old man, in dirty rags like a slave, is a contrast<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
to the garden, in which every plant and tree attests the devoted toil of
his gardeners under his own skilled direction. Odysseus, as yet unrecognized
by his father, asks him how he comes to be in such a mean
attire, though under it he has the look of a king. Then he drops this
tone and says ‘but tell me, whose slave<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> are you, and who owns the
orchard you are tending?’ The hero knows his father, but to preserve
for the present his own incognito he addresses him as the slave that
he appears to be. Now if garden work was done by slaves, surely the
rougher operations of corn-growing were not confined to free labour,
and slaves pass unmentioned as a matter of course. Or are we to
suppose that free labour had been found more economical in the long
run, and so was employed for the production of a staple food? I can
hardly venture to attribute so mature a view to the society of the
Odyssey. We must not forget that animal food, flesh and milk, was an
important element of diet, and that the management of flocks and herds
was therefore a great part of rustic economy. But the herdsmen in
charge are slaves, such as Eumaeus, bought in his youth by Laertes<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
of Phoenician kidnappers. In romancing about his own past experiences
Odysseus describes a raid in Egypt, and how the natives
rallied<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and took their revenge. ‘Many of our company they slew:
others they took alive into the country, to serve them in forced labour.’
As the ravaging of their ‘beautiful farms’ was a chief part of the raiders’
offence, the labour exacted from these captives seems most probably
agricultural.</p>

<p>An interesting question arises in reference to the faithful slaves,
the swineherd and the goatherd. When Odysseus promises them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
rewards in the event of his destroying the suitors with their help, does
this include an offer of freedom? Have we here, as some have thought,
a case of manumission—of course in primitive form, without the legal
refinements of later times? The promise is made<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> so to speak in the
character of a father-in-law: ‘I will provide you both with wives and
give you possessions and well-built houses near to me, and you shall
in future be to me comrades and brothers of Telemachus.’ The ‘brotherhood’
suggested sounds as if it must imply freedom. But does it?
Eumaeus had been brought up<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> by Laertes as the playmate of his
daughter Ctimene; yet he remained nevertheless a slave. Earlier in
the poem Eumaeus, excusing the poor entertainment that he can offer
the stranger (Odysseus), laments the absence<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of his lord, ‘who’ he says
‘would have shewn me hearty affection and given me possessions such
as a kindly lord gives his slave (οἰκῆι), a house and a land-lot (κλῆρον)
and a wife of recognized worth (πολυμνήστην), as a reward for laborious
and profitable service.’ Here also there is no direct reference to an
expected grant of freedom: nor do I think that it is indirectly implied.
It is no doubt tempting to detect in these passages the germ of the
later manumission. But it is not easy to say why, in a world of little
groups ruled by noble chiefs, the gift of freedom should have been a
longed-for boon. However high-born the slave might have been in his
native land, in Ithaca he was simply a slave. If by belonging to a lord
he got material comfort and protection, what had he to gain by becoming
a mere wage-earner? surely nothing. I can see no ground for believing
that in the society of the ‘heroic’ age the bare name of freedom was
greatly coveted. It was high birth that really mattered, but the effect
of this would be local: nothing would make Eumaeus, though son of
a king, noble in Ithaca. No doubt the slave might be at the mercy of
a cruel lord. Such a slave would long for freedom, but such a lord was
not likely to grant it. On the whole, it is rash to read manumission into
the poet’s words.</p>

<p>Reviewing the evidence presented by these ‘Homeric’ poems, it may
be well to insist on the obvious truism that we are not dealing with
formal treatises, charged with precise definitions and accurate statistics.
The information given by the poet drops out incidentally while he is
telling his tale and making his characters live. It is all the more genuine
because it is not furnished in support of a particular argument: but it
is at the same time all the less complete. And it is not possible to say
how far this or that detail may have been coloured by imagination.
Still, allowing freely for the difficulty suggested by these considerations,
I think we are justified in drawing a general inference as to the position
of handworkers, particularly on the land, in Greek ‘heroic’ society as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
conceived by the poet. If the men who practise handicrafts are freemen,
and their presence welcome, this does not exalt them to anything
like equality with the warrior nobles and chiefs. And in agriculture
the labourer is either a slave or a wage-earner of a very dependent
kind. The lord shews no inclination to set his own hand to the plough.
When one of the suitors derisively invites the supposed beggar to
abandon his idle vagrancy for a wage-earning ‘job on the land,’ the
disguised Odysseus retorts<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> ‘Ah, if only you and I could compete in a
match as reapers hard at work fasting from dawn to dark, or at ploughing
a big field with a pair of full-fed spirited oxen,—you would soon see
what I could do.’ He adds that, if it came to war, his prowess would
soon silence the sneer at his begging for food instead of working. Now,
does the hero imply that he would really be willing to reap or plough?
I do not think so: what he means is that he is conscious of that reserve
of bodily strength which appears later in the poem, dramatically shewn
in the bending of the famous bow.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV">IV. HESIOD.</h3>

<p><b>Hesiod, Works and Days.</b> Whether this curious poem belongs in
its present shape to the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, or not, I need not attempt to
decide. It seems certain that it is later than the great Homeric poems,
but is an early work, perhaps somewhat recast and interpolated, yet
in its main features representing conditions and views of a society rural,
half-primitive, aristocratic. I see no reason to doubt that it may fairly
be cited in evidence for my present purpose. The scene of the ‘Works’
is in Boeotia: the works (ἔργα) are operations of farming, and the
precepts chiefly saws of rustic wisdom. Poverty<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> is the grim spectre
that haunts the writer, conscious of the oppressions of the proud and
the hardness of a greedy world. Debt, want, beggary, must be avoided
at all costs. They can only be avoided<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> by thrift, forethought, watchfulness,
promptitude that never procrastinates, and toil that never ceases.
And the mere appeal to self-interest is reinforced by recognizing the
stimulus of competition (ἔρις)<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> which in the form of honest rivalry is a
good influence. The poet represents himself as owner of a land-lot
(κλῆρος)<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, part of a larger estate, the joint patrimony of his brother
Perses and himself: this estate has already been divided, but points
of dispute still remain. Hesiod suggests that Perses has been wronging
him with the help of bribed ‘kings.’ But wrongdoing is not the true
road to wellbeing. A dinner of herbs and a clear conscience are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
better way. As the proverb says ‘half is more than the whole.’ Perses
is treated to much good advice, the gist of which is first and foremost
an exhortation<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> to work (ἐργάζευ), that is, work on the land, in which
is the source of honourable wealth. Personal labour is clearly meant:
it is in the sweat<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of his brow that the farmer is to thrive. Such is the
ordinance of the gods. Man is meant to resemble<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the worker bee, not
the worthless drone. It is not ἔργον but idleness (ἀεργίη) that is a
reproach. Get wealth<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> by working, and the idler will want to rival you:
honour and glory attend on wealth. Avoid delays<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and vain talk: the
procrastinator is never sure of a living; for he is always hoping, when
he should act. Whether sowing or ploughing or mowing, off with your
outer<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> garment, if you mean to get your farm-duties done in due season.
The farmer must rise early, and never get behindhand with his work: to
be in time, and never caught napping by changes of weather, is his duty.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of humble and strenuous life, very different from
the scenes portrayed in the ‘heroic’ epics. It seems to belong to a later
and less warlike age. But the economic and social side of life is in
many respects little changed. The free handicraftsmen seem much
the same. Jealousy of rivals<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> in the same trade—potter, carpenter,
beggar, or bard—is a touch that attests their freedom. The smith, the
weaver, the shoemaker, and the shipwright, are mentioned<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
    also. Seafaring<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
for purposes of gain illustrates what men will dare in quest of
wealth. You should not cast a man’s poverty<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in his teeth: but do not
fancy that men will give you<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> of their store, if you and your family fall
into poverty. Clearly the beggar is not more welcome than he was in
the world of the Odyssey. Suppliant and stranger are protected<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> by
religion, and a man should honour his aged father, if he would see good
days. A motive suggested for careful service of the gods is ‘that you
may buy another’s estate<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and not another buy yours’—that is, that
the gods may give you increase. Just so you should keep a watch-dog,
that thieves<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> may not steal your goods by night. Hesiod’s farmer is to
keep the social and religious rules and usages—but he is before all
things a keen man of business, no Roman more so.</p>

<p>The labour employed by this close-fisted countryman is partly free
partly slave. In a passage<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> of which the exact rendering is disputed
the hired man (θῆτα) and woman (ἔριθον) are mentioned as a matter
of course. For a helper (ἀνδρὶ φίλῳ)<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> his wage must be secure (ἄρκιος)
as stipulated. References to slaves (δμῶες)<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> are more frequent, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the need of constant watchfulness, to see that they are not lazy and
are properly fed housed and rested, is insisted on. The feeding of
cattle and slaves is regulated according to their requirements in different
seasons of the year: efficiency is the object, and evidently experience
is the guide. Of female slaves there is no certain<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> mention: indeed
there could be little demand for domestic attendants in the farmer’s
simple home. Such work as weaving<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> is to be done by his wife. For
the farmer is to marry, though the risks<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> of that venture are not hidden
from the poet, who gives plain warnings as to the exercise of extreme
care in making a suitable choice. The operations of agriculture are
the usual ploughing sowing reaping threshing and the processes of the
vineyard and the winepress. Oxen sheep and mules form the live-stock.
Corn is the staple<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> diet, with hay as fodder for beasts.</p>

<p>Looking on the picture as a whole, we see that the Hesiodic farmer
is to be a model of industry and thrift. Business, not sentiment, is the
note of his character. His function is to survive in his actual circumstances;
that is, in a social and economic environment of normal selfishness.
If his world is not a very noble one, it is at least eminently
practical. He is a true αὐτουργός, setting his own hand to the plough,
toiling for himself on his own land, with slaves and other cattle obedient
to his will. It is perhaps not too much to say that he illustrates a great
truth bearing on the labour-question,—that successful exploitation of
other men’s labour is, at least in semi-primitive societies, only to be
achieved by the man who shares the labour himself. And it is to be
noted that he attests the existence of wage-earning hands as well as
slaves. I take this to mean that there were in his rustic world a number
of landless freemen compelled to make a living as mere farm labourers.
That we hear so much less of this class in later times is probably to
be accounted for by the growth of cities and the absorption of such
persons in urban occupations and trades.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">V. STRAY NOTES FROM EARLY POETS.</h3>

<p>A few fragments may be cited as of interest, bearing on our subject.
The most important are found in the remains<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of Solon, illustrating the
land-question as he saw and faced it at the beginning of the sixth
century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. The poets of the seventh and sixth centuries reflect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
problems of an age of unrest, among the causes of which the introduction
of metallic coinage, susceptible of hoarding and unaffected by
weather, played a great part. Poverty, debt and slavery of debtors,
hardship, begging, the insolence and oppression of rich and greedy
creditors, are common topics. The sale of free men into slavery
abroad is lamented by Solon, who claims to have restored many
such victims by his measures of reform. In particular, he removed
encumbrances on land, thus setting free the small farmers who were in
desperate plight owing to debt. The exact nature and scope of his
famous reform is a matter of dispute. Whether he relieved freeholders
from a burden of debt, or emancipated the clients<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> of landowning nobles
from dependence closely akin to serfdom, cannot be discussed here,
and does not really bear on the matter in hand. In either case the
persons relieved were a class of working farmers, and the economic
reform was the main thing: political reform was of value as tending to
secure the economic boon. It is remarkable that Solon, enumerating
a number of trades (practically the old Homeric and Hesiodic list),
speaks of them merely as means of escaping the pressure of poverty,
adding ‘and another man<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> is yearly servant to those interested in
ploughing, and furrows land planted with fruit-trees.’ This man seems
to be a wage-earner (θὴς) working for a large farmer, probably the
owner of a landed estate in the rich lowland (πεδιάς) of Attica. The
small farmers were mostly confined to the rocky uplands. Evidently
it is not manual labour that is the hardship, but the dependent position
of the hired man working on another’s land. The hard-working independent
peasant, willing to till stony land for his own support, is the
type that Solon encouraged and Peisistratus<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> approved.</p>

<p>The life of such peasant farmers was at best a hard one, and little
desired by men living under easier conditions. Two fragments from
Ionia express views of dwellers in that rich and genial land. <b>Phocylides</b>
of Miletus in one of his wise counsels says ‘if you desire wealth, devote
your care to a fat farm (πίονος ἀγροῦ), for the saying is that a farm is
a horn of plenty.’ The bitter <b>Hipponax</b> of Ephesus describes a man
as having lived a gluttonous life and so eaten up his estate (τὸν κλῆρον):
the result is that he is driven to dig a rocky hillside and live on common
figs and barley bread—mere slave’s fodder (δούλιον χόρτον). Surely the
‘fat farm’ was not meant to be worked by the owner singlehanded;
and the ‘slave’s fodder’ suggests the employment of slaves. Ionia was
a home of luxury and ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>The oft-quoted scolion of the Cretan <b>Hybrias</b> illustrates the point
of view of the warrior class in more military communities. His wealth
is in sword spear and buckler. It is with these tools that he does his
ploughing reaping or vintage. That is, he has command of the labour
of others, and enjoys their produce. We shall speak below of the well-known
lords and serfs of Crete.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI">VI. TRACES OF SERFDOM IN GREEK STATES.</h3>

<p>Before passing on to the times in which the merits of a free farmer-class,
from military and political points of view, became a matter of
general and conscious consideration, it is desirable to refer briefly to
the recorded cases of agricultural serfdom in Greek states. For the
rustic serf is a type quite distinct from the free farmer, the hired
labourer, or the slave; though the language of some writers is loose,
and does not clearly mark the distinction. Six well-known cases present
themselves, in connexion with Sparta, Crete, Argos, Thessaly,
Syracuse, and Heraclea on the Pontus. Into the details of these systems
it is not necessary to enter, interesting though many of them are. The
important feature common to them all is the delegation of agricultural
labour. A stronger or better-organized people become masters of a
weaker population, conquering their country by force of arms, and
sparing the conquered on certain terms. The normal effect of the compact
is that the conquerors are established as a ruling warrior class,
whose subsistence is provided by the labour of the subject people.
These subjects remain on the land as farmers, paying a fixed quota
of their produce to their masters. Some are serfs of the state, and pay
their dues to the state authorities: some are serfs of individuals, and
pay to their lords. In either case they are strictly attached to the land,
and cannot be sold out of the country. This clearly marks off the serf
from the slave held in personal bondage. In some cases certainly,
probably in all, the warrior class (at least the wealthier of them) had
also slaves for their own personal service. The serf-system differs from
a caste-system. Both, it is true, are hereditary systems, or have a strong
tendency to become so. The ruling class do not easily admit deserving
subjects into their own ranks. And they take precautions to hinder
the degradation of their equals into lower conditions through poverty.
The warrior’s land-lot (κλᾶρος), the sale of which is forbidden, is a
favourite institution for the purpose. That such warrior aristocracies
could not be kept up in vigour for an indefinite time, was to be proved
by experience. Their duration depended on external as well as internal
conditions. Hostile invasion might destroy the efficiency of state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
regulations, however well adapted to keep the serfs under control.
Sparta always feared her Helots, and it was essential to keep an enemy
out of Laconia. Early in the history of Syracuse the unprivileged
masses were supported by the serfs in their rising against the squatter-lords,
the γαμόροι whose great estates represented the allotments of
the original settlers. In Crete and Thessaly matters were complicated
by lack of a central authority. There were a number of cities: subordination
and cooperation were alike hard to secure, and the history
of both groups is a story of jealousy, collisions, and weakness. The
Thessalian Penestae often rebelled. The two classes of Cretan<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> serfs
(public and private) were kept quiet partly by rigid exclusion from all
training of a military kind, partly by their more favourable condition:
but the insular position of Crete was perhaps a factor of equal importance.
The long control of indigenous barbarian serfs by the city of
Heraclea was probably the result of similar causes.</p>

<p>But in all these cases it is conquest that produces the relation between
the tiller of the soil and his overlord. Whether the serf is regarded
as a weaker Greek or as a Barbarian (non-Greek) is not at present the
main question from my point of view. The notion of castes, belonging
to the same society and influenced by the same racial and religious
traditions, but each performing a distinct function—priestly military
agricultural etc.—as in ancient India, is another thing altogether. Caste
separates functions, but the division is in essence collateral. Serfdom
is a delegation of functions, and is a compulsory subordination.
That the Greeks of the seventh and sixth centuries <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> were already
becoming conscious of a vital difference between other races and themselves,
is fairly certain. It was soon to express itself in the common
language. Contact with Persia was soon to crystallize this feeling into
a moral antipathy, a disgust and contempt that found voice in the
arrogant claim that while nature’s law justifies the ruling of servile
Barbarians by free Greeks, a reversal of the relation is an unnatural
monstrosity. Yet I cannot discover that Greeks ever gave up enslaving
brother Greeks. Callicratidas in the field and Plato in his school might
protest against the practice; it still remained the custom in war to sell
as slaves those, Greek or Barbarian, whom the sword had spared.
We shall also find cases in which the remnant of the conquered
were left in their homes but reduced to the condition of cultivating
serfs.</p>

<p>Among the little that is known of the ancient Etruscans, whose
power was once widely extended in Italy, is the fact that they dwelt in
cities and ruled a serf population who lived chiefly in the country. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
ruling race were apparently invaders not akin to any of the Italian
stocks: their subjects probably belonged to the old Ligurian race, in
early times spread over a large part of the peninsula. That the
Etruscan cities recognized a common interest, but in practice did not
support each other consistently, was the chief cause of their gradual
weakening and final fall. Noble lords with warlike traditions had little
bent for farm life or sympathy with the serfs who tilled the soil. The
two classes seem to have kept to their own<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> languages, and the
Etruscan gradually died out under the supremacy of Rome.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VII">VII. HERODOTUS.</h3>

<p><b>Herodotus</b>, writing in the first half of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, partly
recording the results of his own travels, partly dependent on the work
of his predecessors, is a witness of great value. In him we find the
contrast and antipathy<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> of Greek and Barbarian an acknowledged fact,
guiding and dominating Greek sentiment. Unhappily he yields us
very little evidence bearing on the present subject. To slavery and
slave-trade he often refers without comment: these are matters of
course. The servile character of oriental peoples subject to Persia is
contemptuously described<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> through the mouth of the Greek queen of
Halicarnassus. Nor does he spare the Ionian Greeks, whose jealousies
and consequent inefficiency made them the unworthy tools of Persian
ambition; a sad contrast to those patriotic Greeks of old Hellas who,
fired by the grand example of Athens, fought for their freedom and
won it in the face of terrible odds. The disgust—a sort of physical
loathing—with which the free Greek, proud of training his body to perfection,
regarded corporal mutilation as practised in the East, is illustrated
by such passages<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> as that in which the Persians are astounded
at the Greek athletic competitions for a wreath of olive leaves, and that
in which he coolly tells the story of the eunuch’s revenge. But all this,
interesting as giving us his point of view, does not help us in clearing
up the relations of free and slave labour. As for handicrafts, it is
enough to refer to the well-known passage<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> in which, while speaking
of Egypt, he will not decide whether the Greeks got their contempt for
manual trades from the Egyptians or not. That the Greeks, above all
the Spartans, do despise χειρωναξίαι, is certain; but least true of the
Corinthians. Barbarians in general respect the warrior class among
their own folk and regard manual trades as ignoble. So the source of
Greek prejudice is doubtful. That the craftsmen are free is clear from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the whole context. It is remarkable that in enumerating seven classes
of the Egyptian population he mentions no class<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> as devoted to the
tillage of the soil, but two of herdsmen, in charge of cattle and swine.
Later authorities mention<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> the γεωργοί, and connect them with the
military class, rightly, it would seem: for Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> refers to the
farms granted by the kings to this class. They are farmer-soldiers. It
would seem that they were free, so far as any Egyptian could be called
free, and worked their land themselves. If this inference be just, we
may observe that a Greek thought it a fact worth noting. Was this
owing to the contrast<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> offered by systems of serfage in the Greek world?</p>

<p>It is curious that wage-labour is hardly ever directly mentioned.
In describing<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the origin of the Macedonian kings, who claimed descent
from an Argive stock, he says that three brothers, exiles from Argos,
came to Macedon. There they served the king for wages as herdsmen
in charge of his horses cattle sheep and goats. The simplicity of the
royal household is emphasized as illustrating the humble scale of
ancient monarchies. Alarmed by a prodigy, the king calls his servants
(τοὺς θῆτας) and tells them to leave his country. The sequel does not
concern us here: we need only note that work for wages is referred to
as a matter of course. The same relation is probably meant in the
case of the Arcadian deserters<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> who came to Xerxes after Thermopylae,
in need of sustenance (βίου) and wishing to get work (ἐνεργοὶ εἶναι).
But the term θητεύειν is not used. And the few Athenians who stayed
behind<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in the Acropolis when Athens was evacuated, partly through
sheer poverty (ὑπ’ ἀσθενείης βίου), would seem to be θῆτες. It is fair
to infer that hired labour is assumed as a normal fact in Greek life.
For the insistence on poverty<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> as naturally endemic (σύντροφος) in
Hellas, only overcome by the manly qualities (ἀρετὴ) developed in the
conquest of hard conditions by human resourcefulness (σοφίη), shews us
the background of the picture present to the writer’s mind. It is his
way of telling us that the question of food-supply was a serious one.
Out of her own soil Hellas was only able to support a thin population.
Hence Greek forces were absurdly small compared with the myriads
of Persia: but the struggle for existence had strung them up to such
efficiency and resolute love of freedom that they were ready to face
fearful odds.</p>

<p>The passage occurs in the reply of Demaratus the Spartan to a
question of Xerxes, and refers more particularly to Sparta. In respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of courage and military efficiency the claim is appropriate: but poverty
was surely characteristic of nearly all the European Hellas, and the
language on that point is strictly correct, probably representing the
writer’s own view. It is also quite consistent with the statement<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> that
in early times, before the Athenians had as yet driven all the indigenous
population out of Attica, neither the Athenians nor the
Greeks generally had slaves (οἰκέτας). The context seems to indicate
that domestic slaves are specially meant. I do not lay much stress on
this allegation, urged as it is in support of a case by one party to the
dispute: but it is a genuine tradition, which appears again in the later
literature. In the time of Herodotus there were plenty of domestic
slaves. Accordingly he finds it worth while to mention<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that Scythian
kings are attended by persons of their own race, there being no bought
servants employed.</p>

<p>Herodotus is a difficult witness to appraise justly, partly from the
occasional uncertainty as to whether he is really pledging his own
authority on a point, partly because the value of his authority varies
greatly on different points. But on the whole I take his evidence to
suggest that agriculture was carried on in Greece either by free
labouring farmers employing hired men when needed, or by serfs. I
do not see any evidence to shew that no slaves were employed. The
subject of his book placed him under no necessity of mentioning them:
and I can hardly believe that farm-slavery on a small scale had died
out all over Greece since the days of Hesiod. Nor do I feel convinced
on his authority that the poverty of Greece was, so far as mere food
is concerned, as extreme as he makes Demaratus represent it. When
the Spartans heard that Xerxes was offering the Athenians a separate
peace, they were uneasy, and sent a counter-offer<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> on their own behalf.
Not content with appealing to the Hellenic patriotism of Athens, they
said ‘We feel for you in your loss of two crops and the distress that
will last some while yet. But you shall have all this made good. We,
Spartans and confederates, will find food for your wives and your
helpless families<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> so long as this war lasts.’ Supposing this offer to
have been actually made, and to have been capable of execution,
surely it implies that there were food-stuffs to spare in the Peloponnese.
It may be that I am making too much of this passage, and
of the one about poverty. The dramatic touch of Herodotus is present
in both, and I must leave the apparent inconsistency between them as
it stands. The question of Peloponnesian agriculture will come up
again in connexion with a passage of Thucydides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII">VIII. THE TRAGEDIANS.</h3>

<p>The lives of <b>Aeschylus</b> (died 456 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) <b>Sophocles</b> and <b>Euripides</b>
(both died 406 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) cover a period of stirring events in the history of
Greece, particularly of Athens. <b>Aeschylus</b> had borne his part in the
Persian wars: he was a fighting man when Herodotus was born, and
Sophocles a boy. Euripides saw the rise of Athenian power to its
greatest height, and died with Sophocles on the eve of its fall. These
men had seen strange and terrible things. Hellas had only beaten off
the Persian to ruin herself by her own internecine conflicts. While the
hatred and contempt for ‘barbarians’ grew from sentiment into something
very like a moral principle, Greeks butchered or enslaved brother
Greeks on an unprecedented scale. Greek lands were laid waste by
Greek armies: the devastation of Attica in particular had serious
effects on the politics and policy of Athens. Athens at length lost her
control of the Euxine corn trade and was starved out. For the moment
a decision was reached: the reactionary rural powers, backed by the
commercial jealousy of Corinth, had triumphed. No thoughtful man
in Athens during the time when the rustic population were crowded
into the city, idle and plagued with sickness, could be indifferent to the
strain on democratic institutions. This spectacle suggested reflexions
that permanently influenced Greek thought on political subjects. The
tendency was to accept democracy in some form and degree as inevitable
in most states, and to seek salvation in means of checking the
foolish extravagancies of mob-rule. The best of these means was the
encouragement of farmer-citizens: but the circumstances of Greek
history made practical success on these lines impossible. In practice,
oligarchy meant privilege, to which a scattered farming population
would submit; democracy meant mob-rule sooner or later, and the
dominance of urban interests. The problem which Plato and Aristotle
could not solve was already present in the latter part of the Peloponnesian
war. Aristophanes might ridicule Euripides, but on the country-and-town
issue the two were agreed.</p>

<p><b>Aeschylus</b> indeed furnishes very little to my purpose directly.
The Greek antipathy to the Barbarian is very clearly marked; but the
only points worth noting are that in the <i>Persae</i><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> he makes Persian
speakers refer to their own people as βάρβαροι, and that in a bitter
passage of the <i>Eumenides</i> he expresses<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> his loathing of mutilations and
tortures, referring no doubt to Persian cruelties. Agriculture can hardly
be said to be mentioned at all, for the gift of weather-wisdom<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
useful to others than the farmer, and the Scythian steppes are untilled
land. A fragment, telling of a happy land<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> where all things grow in
plenty unsown without ploughing or digging, reminds us of the
Odyssey, minus the savages: another, referring to the advance made
in domestication of beasts to relieve men of toil, make up the meagre
list. All are in connexion with Prometheus. There are two interesting
passages<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> in which the word γαμόρος (landholder) occurs, but merely
as an expression for a man with the rights and responsibilities of a
citizen. There is nothing of tillage. It was natural for the champion
of the power of the Areopagus to view the citizen from the landholding
side. He is a respecter of authority, but at the same time lays great
stress on the duty and importance of deference to public opinion. This
tone runs through the surviving plays, wherever the scene of a particular
drama may be laid. Athenian conditions are always in his mind,
and his final judgment appears in the <i>Eumenides</i> as an appeal to all
true citizens to combine freedom with order. Ties of blood, community
of religious observances, the relation between citizens and aliens, are
topics on which he dwells again and again. In general it is fair to
conclude that, while he cheerfully accepted the free constitution of
Athens as it stood since the democratic reform of Cleisthenes, he
thought that it was quite democratic enough, and regarded more recent
tendencies with some alarm. Now these tendencies, in particular the
reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles, were certainly in the direction of
lessening the influence of the Attic farmers and increasing that of the
urban citizens, who were on the spot to take advantage of them. To
put it in the briefest form, Aeschylus must be reckoned an admirer of
the solid and responsible citizens of the old school, men with a stake
in the country.</p>

<p><b>Sophocles</b> also supplies very little. The antipathy of Greeks to
Barbarians appears in a milder form: Aeschylus was naturally more
bitter, having fought against the Persian invader. The doctrine that
public opinion (of citizens) ought to be respected, that obedience to
constituted authorities is a duty, in short the principle that freedom
should be combined with order, is set forth in various passages of
dramatic debate. Yet the scenes of the plays, as those of Aeschylus,
are laid in legendary ages that knew not democracy. The awful
potency of ties of blood, and the relations of citizen and alien, are
topics common to both. But I think it may fairly be said that
political feeling is less evident in Sophocles. This is consistent with
his traditional character. In their attitude towards slavery there is
no striking difference: both treat it as a matter of course. But in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Sophocles there are already signs<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> of the questioning that was soon
to become outspoken, as to the justice of the relation of master and
slave. Agriculture is hardly mentioned. The words γεωργός, γεωργεῖν,
γεωργία, are (as in Aeschylus) not used. A reference to ploughing
occurs in a famous passage<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> celebrating the resourcefulness of Man.
The herdsman, usually a slave, is once<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> spoken of as perhaps a hired
servant. One curious passage<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> calls for notice. In the <i>Trachiniae</i>
the indifference of Heracles to his children is compared by his wife
Deianira to the conduct of a farmer (γῄτης) who has got a farm at a
distance (ἄρουραν ἔκτοπον) and only visits it at seed-time and harvest.
The man is apparently a non-resident landowner, living presumably
in the city (surely Athens is in the poet’s mind) and working his farm
by deputy—a steward—and only inspecting it at important seasons.
Whether the labour employed is slave or free, there is nothing to
shew. It is of interest to find the situation sufficiently real to be used
in a simile. But I infer that the situation, like the conduct of Heracles,
is regarded as exceptional.</p>

<p><b>Euripides</b> takes us into a very different atmosphere. An age of
movement was also an age of criticism and inquiry, social religious
political ethical. The intellectual leaders came from various parts of
the Greek world, but the intellectual centre of ‘obstinate questionings’
was Athens, and their poet Euripides. The use of drama, with plots
drawn from ancient legend, as a vehicle for reflexions on human
problems, addressed to a contemporary audience and certain to evoke
assent and dissent, is the regular practice of Euripides. His plays
give us a mass of information as to the questions exercising the
minds of thoughtful men in a stirring period. The point of view is
that of the new school, the enlightened ‘thinkers’ who claimed the
right to challenge traditional principles, opinions, prejudices, and
institutions, testing them by the canons of human reason fearlessly
applied. This attitude was naturally resented by men of the old
school, averse to any disturbing influence tending to undermine the
traditional morality, and certain to react upon politics. Their opposition
can still be traced in the comedies of Aristophanes and in various
political movements during the Peloponnesian war. Among the
topics to which the new school turned their attention were two of
special interest to Euripides. The power of wealth was shewing itself
in the growth of capitalistic enterprise, an illustration of which is
seen in the case of the rich slaveowner Nicias. Poverty<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
disadvantages, sometimes amounting to sheer degradation, was as
ever a subject of discontent: and this was closely connected with
the position of free wage-earning labour. At Athens political action
took a strong line in the direction of utilizing the wealth of the rich
in the service of the state: for the poor, its dominant tendency was
to provide opportunities of drawing state pay (μισθός), generally a
bare living wage, for the performance of various public duties. The
other topic, that of slavery, had as yet hardly reached the stage of
questioning the right or wrong of that institution as such. But the
consciousness that the slave, like his master, was a blend of human
virtues and human vices,—was a man, in short,—was evidently becoming
clearer, and suggesting the conclusion that he must be judged
as a man and not as a mere chattel. Otherwise Euripides would
hardly have ventured to bring slaves on the stage<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> in so sympathetic
a spirit, or to utter numerous sayings, bearing on their merits and
failings, in a tone of broad humanity.</p>

<p>In such circumstances how came it that there was no sign of a
movement analogous to modern Abolitionism? If the slave was
confessedly a man, had he not the rights of a man? The answer is
plain. That a man, simply as a man, had any rights, was a doctrine
not yet formulated or clearly conceived. The antipathy<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> between
Greek and Barbarian was a practical bar to its recognition. The
Persian was not likely to moderate his treatment of Greeks in his
power from any such consideration: superior force, nothing less,
would induce him to conform to Greek notions of humanity. While
force was recognized as the sole foundation of right as against free
enemies, there could not be much serious doubt as to the right of
holding aliens in slavery. But in this questioning age another
theoretical basis of discussion had been found. Men were testing
institutions by asking in reference to each ‘is it a natural<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> growth?
does it exist by nature (φύσει)? or is it a conventional status? does
it exist by law (νόμῳ)?’ Here was one of the most unsettling inquiries
of the period. In reference to slavery we find two conflicting doctrines
beginning to emerge. One is<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> that all men are born free (φύσει) and
that slavery is therefore a creation of man’s device (νόμῳ). The other
is that superior strength is a gift of nature, and therefore the rule of
the weaker<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> by the stronger is according to nature. The conflict
between these two views was destined to engage some of the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
minds of Greece in later years, when the political failure of the Greek
states had diverted men’s thoughts to problems concerning the individual.
For the present slavery was taken for granted, but it is
evident that the seeds of future doubt had been sown. Among the
stray utterances betraying uneasiness is the oft-quoted saying<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> of the
sophist Alcidamas ‘god leaves all men free: nature makes no man a
slave.’ The speaker was contemporary with Euripides, whose sayings
are often in much the same tone, if less direct. A remarkable passage
is that in which he makes Heracles repudiate<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> the myths that represent
slavery as existing among the gods. No god that is a real god
has any needs, and such tales are rubbish—an argument that was
destined to reappear later as bearing upon slavery among men,
particularly in connexion with the principles of the Cynic school.</p>

<p>I have said enough as to the point of view from which the
questioners, such as Euripides, regarded slavery. It is somewhat
surprising that the poet’s references to hired labour<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> are very few,
and all of a depressing kind, treating θητεύειν as almost or quite
equivalent to δουλεύειν. The references or allusions to handicrafts
are hardly to the point: such men are doubtless conceived as θῆτες,
but they would generally direct themselves in virtue of their trade-skill:
they are not hired ‘hands.’ Herdsmen often appear, but
generally if not always they seem to be slaves or serfs. Nor is it
clear that the digger (σκαφεύς) is free; he is referred to<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> as a specimen
of the meanest class of labourer. But in three of the plays there
occur passages directly descriptive of the poor working farmer, the
αὐτουργὸς of whom I have spoken above. In the <i>Electra</i>, the prologue
is put in the mouth of the poor but well-born αὐτουργὸς to whom the
crafty Aegisthus has given Electra in marriage. The scene between
husband and wife is one of peculiar delicacy and interest. The points
that concern us here are these. The princess has been united<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> to a
poor and powerless freeman. He is fully occupied<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> with the hard
labour of his farm, which he apparently cultivates singlehanded. He
understands the motive of Aegisthus, and shews his respect for
Electra by refraining from conjugal rights. She in turn respects his
nobility, and shews her appreciation by cheerfully performing<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> the
humble duties of a cottar’s wife. When the breadwinner (ἐργάτης)
comes home from toil, he should find all ready for his comfort. He is
shocked to see her, a lady of gentle breeding (εὖ τεθραμμένη) fetch
water from the spring and wait upon his needs. But he has to accept
the situation: the morrow’s dawn<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> shall see him at his labour on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
land: it is all very well to pray for divine aid, but to get a living the
first thing needful is to work. Now here we have a picture of the
free farmer on a small scale, who lives in a hovel and depends on the
labour of his own hands. He is the ancient analogue of the French
peasant, who works harder than any slave, and whose views are apt
to be limited by the circumstances of his daily life. He has no slaves<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.
Again, the Theban herald in the <i>Supplices</i><a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, speaking of the incapacity
of a Demos for the function of government, says ‘but a poor husbandman
(γαπόνος ἀνὴρ πένης), even if not stupid, will be too busy to
attend to state affairs.’ Here is our toiling rustic, the ideal citizen of
statesmen who desire to keep free from popular control. The same
character appears again in the <i>Orestes</i>, on the occasion of a debate in
the Argive Assembly (modelled on Athens), as defender of Orestes.
He is described<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> as ‘not of graceful mien, but a manly fellow, one
who seldom visits the city and the market-place, a toiler with his
hands (αὐτουργός), of the class on whom alone the safety of the
country depends; but intelligent and prepared to face the conflict of
debate, a guileless being of blameless life.’ So vivid is this portrait,
that the sympathy of the poet with the rustic type of citizen can
hardly be ignored. Now, why did Euripides take pains to shew this
sympathy? I take it to be a sign that he saw with regret the declining
influence of the farmer class in Attic politics.</p>

<p>Can we go a step further, and detect in these passages any sort of
protest against a decline in the number of small working farmers,
and a growth of exploitation-farming, carried on by stewards directing
the labour of slaves or hired hands? In the next generation we find
this system in use, as indeed it most likely always had been to some
extent on the richer soils of lowland Attica. The concentration of
the country folk in the city during the great war would tend to promote
agriculture by deputy after the return of peace. Deaths, and
the diversion of some farmers to other pursuits, were likely to leave
vacancies in the rural demes. Speculators who took advantage of
such chances to buy land would not as a rule do so with intent to
live on the land and work it themselves; and aliens were not allowed
to hold real estate. It seems fairly certain that landlords resident in
Athens, to whom land was only one of many forms of investment,
and who either let their land to tenant-farmers or exploited its cultivation
under stewards, were a class increased considerably by the
effects of the war. We shall see further reasons below for believing
this. Whether Euripides in the passages cited above is actually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
warning or protesting, I do not venture to say: that he grasped the
significance of a movement beginning under his very eyes, is surely a
probable conjecture.</p>

<p>That we should hear little of the employment of slaves in the
hard work of agriculture, even if the practice were common, is not to
be wondered at. Assuming the existence of slavery, there was no
need for any writer other than a specialist to refer to them. But we
have in the <i>Rhesus</i> a passage<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> in which Hector forecasts the result of
an attack on the Greeks while embarking: some of them will be
slain, and the rest, captured and made fast in bonds, will be taught
to cultivate (γαπονεῖν) the fields of the Phrygians. That this use of
captives is nothing extraordinary appears below, when Dolon the spy
is bargaining for a reward in case of success. To a suggestion that
one of the Greek chiefs should be assigned to him he replies ‘No,
hands gently nurtured (εὖ ’τεθραμμέναι)<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> are unfit for farm-work
(γεωργεῖν).’ The notion of captive Greeks slaving on the land for
Asiatic lords is a touch meant to be provocative of patriotic indignation.
And the remark of Dolon would surely fall more meaningly on
the ears of men acquainted with the presence of rustic slavery in their
own country. To serfage we have a reference<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> in the <i>Heraclidae</i>, but
the retainer (πενέστης) is under arms, ‘mobilized,’ not at the time
working on the land. His reward, when he brings the news of victory,
is to be freedom.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX">IX. THE ‘CONSTITUTION OF ATHENS’ OR ‘OLD OLIGARCH.’</h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable documents that have come down to
us bearing upon Athenian politics is the ‘Constitution<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> of Athens’
wrongly assigned to Xenophon. It is certainly the work of an earlier
writer, and the date of its composition can be fixed as between 430
and 424 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. Thus it refers to the first years of the Peloponnesian
war, during which Attica was repeatedly invaded, its rural economy
upset, and the manifold consequences of overcrowding in the city of
refuge were beginning to shew themselves. Not a few of the ‘better
classes’ of Athenian citizens (οἱ βέλτιστοι) were dissatisfied with the
readiness of the Demos, under the guidance of Pericles, to carry out
a maritime and aggressive policy abroad at the cost of sacrificing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
rural interests at home. For the sacrifice fell on the landowners,
more particularly on the larger owners: the compensations<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> of state-pay
and chances of plunder might suffice for the peasant farmer
driven into Athens. At the same time it was undeniable that the
astounding energy displayed by democratic Athens had surprised
the Greek world; and the most discontented Athenian could hardly
suppress an emotion of patriotic pride. The writer of the pamphlet
before us—for a pamphlet it is—was under the influence of these
conflicting feelings. Whether it is right to describe him as an Oligarch
depends on what that term is taken to connote. That he would
greatly prefer a system<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> under which the educated orderly and honest
citizens should enjoy greater consideration and power, is evident:
also that in his view these qualities are normal attributes of the
wealthier classes. For he finds in poverty the main cause<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> of democratic
misdeeds. That the masses are ill-informed and lack judgment
and self-control, is the result of their preoccupation with necessities
of daily life. But from this conviction to aiming at a serious oligarchic
revolution is a long step. The democracy in its less aggressive
form, before the recent developments owing to the presence of an idle
refugee population, might conceivably have sufficed for his requirements.
He is a prejudiced contemporary witness, frank and cynical
in the extreme, praising the Demos for doing the very things that he
hates and despises, because those things are in the interest of the
democracy such as it appears to him: they would be fools to act
otherwise. For convenience sake I follow Mr Zimmern<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> in calling him
the <i>Old Oligarch</i>.</p>

<p>His disgust at the lack of discipline in the slaves at Athens, and
his ingenious explanation<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> of the causes that have led to toleration
of the nuisance, are very characteristic of his whole attitude. But
the slaves of whom he speaks are those labourers whom their owners
allowed to work for hire in the city and Peiraeus, taking a share of
their pay as rent for their services. Perhaps the state slaves are meant
also. He admits that you have to put up with the airs of these
fellows, who often become men of substance (πλούσιοι δοῦλοι) and
think themselves as good as the citizens. Truth is, the master depends
on the return he gets from his investment: if the rent comes in
regularly, he asks no questions and the slave is given<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> a free hand.
No wonder the bondman jostles his betters in the public streets, a
state of things inconceivable in orderly Sparta. Now on the face of
it this picture has nothing to do with the agricultural situation. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
let us look further. The stress of the great war had increased the
city population. The increased demand for imported food-stuffs and
for materials of war (such as ship-timber) had undoubtedly increased
the demand for dock-labourers, boatmen, porters, carters, and other
‘hands.’ Male citizens had enough to do in services by land and sea.
From what source was the extra force of rough able-bodied labour
recruited? Is it likely that a number of raw barbarian slaves were
imported for the purpose? I think not; time would be needed to
make them efficient, and the available shipping had already a difficult
task to keep up the supply of indispensable goods. Is it not much
more likely that rustic slaves, brought into Athens by their owners,
were turned to account<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> in another department of labour, thus
earning wages for themselves while they maintained their masters?
The probability of this view will depend largely on proof that rustic
slaves were employed in Attica under normal conditions at this
time. We shall presently see how the evidence of Aristophanes bears
on the point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let us see what references to agriculture are to be found in
this pamphlet. In speaking of the nautical skill<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> now a common accomplishment
among Athenians, the writer remarks that the possession
of estates abroad, and the duties of offices concerned with external
affairs, have something to do with it. Men have to cross the water:
they and their attendants (ἀκόλουθοι) thus pick up skill by experience
without intending it: for it happens time and again that both master
and slave (καὶ αὐτὸν καὶ τὸν οἰκέτην) have to take a turn at the oar.
The estates referred to are chiefly state-lands allotted to Athenian
cleruchs in confiscated districts, but also private properties. The
voyages to and fro are nothing exceptional. Whether a man resided
on his estate and had need to visit Athens, or whether he resided in
Athens and had to visit his estate from time to time, he must go to
sea. It is to be borne in mind that allottees in cleruchies often let their
lands to the former owners as tenants. In another passage<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> he points
out the disadvantage to Athens, as a maritime power, of not being on
an island and so secure from invasion. ‘As things are, those Athenians
who farm land or are wealthy (οἱ γεωργοῦντες καὶ οἱ πλούσιοι) are more
inclined to conciliate the enemy (ὑπέρχονται = cringe to), while the
Demos, well aware that their own belongings are in no danger of destruction,
is unconcerned and defiant.’ A notable admission, confirmed
by other evidence, as we shall see. It is to be observed that farmers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
and wealthy men are coupled together. The class more especially
meant are probably those represented in Aristophanes by the substantial
farmers of the <i>Peace</i>. But capitalists with investments in land
are also included, and small-holders or tenants; these last working the
land themselves, but not necessarily without employing hired or slave
labour.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_X">X. ARISTOPHANES.</h3>

<p><b>Aristophanes</b> is a witness of great importance. Of eleven surviving
plays the <i>Acharnians</i> appeared in 425 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, the <i>Plutus</i> in 388. Thus we
have from this prince of wit and humour a series of comments on the
social and political life of Athens and Attica from the point of view
of conservative admirers of good old times. The evidence of Comedy
is liable to be suspect, on the ground of a tendency to exaggerate and
distort facts: but to make allowances for this tendency is not a task
of extreme difficulty. Nor can it fairly be said that the political bias
of the poet is such as to deprive his evidence of all authority. If he
seems at times to be singularly detached from the prejudices of the
war-party, dominating Athens under the democratic leaders, and able
to discern and boldly to declare that the right was not solely on their
own side in the war; still he was a warm patriot, devoted to the Athens
whose defects he could not ignore. Among the striking events of the
time nothing seems to have impressed him more forcibly than the devastation
of Attica and the consequent ruin of the agricultural interest.
That the cooping-up of the rural population<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> within the walls month
after month was a progressive calamity, could hardly escape the notice
of any one then resident. It was not merely the squalor or the appalling
sickness, though these were in themselves enough to produce a terrible
strain. Discontent and recklessness took hold of the masses, and other
observers beside Aristophanes remarked the degeneration of the democracy.
Aristophanes was an opponent of the war-policy, and strove hard
to rally the farmer-folk in favour of peace. He spared no pains to
discredit the noisy demagogues, accusing them of prolonging the war
in order to retain or increase their own importance at the cost of the
soundest element in the civic body. But, while he turned the farmers’
grievances to account in political advocacy, he was no mere unscrupulous
partisan. His frequent references to the homely joys of country
life, sometimes in sympathetic rural vignettes, have the ring of sincerity.
Like many another dweller in the unwholesome city, he sighed for the
fresh air, the wholesome food, the peace and quiet of Attic farmsteads:
no doubt he idealized the surroundings, though he did not depict them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
as scenes of spotless innocence. But the details that drop out casually
are often very significant from the point of view of my inquiry, and
very helpful as giving us a genuine picture of the time.</p>

<p>On no point is information more to be desired than the relation of
agriculture to wealth. Is the typical farmer of the period a man of
large estate or not? We have seen that the ‘old oligarch’ classed
together the wealthy and the farmers as favouring a peace-policy. That
such a body of opinion, large or small, existed in Athens, is also suggested
by passages in Aristophanes. In the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i>, the play in
which the leader of the female politicians offers to cure distress by a
communistic scheme, we are told<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> that a proposal to mobilize a fleet
divides the Assembly: the poor man votes for it, but the wealthy and
the farmers are against it. I take it that, as in the case of the Sicilian
expedition, the man who wants to get paid for service (with a chance
of profit) supports the motion; those who dislike having to pay for the
enterprise, or see no way of profiting by it, are in opposition. This is
a phenomenon normal in politics, and does not tell us whether the
‘farmers’ are cultivators on a large scale or small. Later in the play
we find a protest<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> against the iniquity of the present juxtaposition of
wealth and destitution, the state of things in which one man farms
much land while another has not enough to afford him a grave. Even
a comic poet would hardly put this into the mouth of one of his characters
if there were not some section of the audience to whom it might
appeal. It is probable that at the time (393-2 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) communistic
suggestions were among the currents of opinion in humbled and impoverished
Athens. To squeeze the rich had long been the policy of
the democrats, and a jealousy of wealth in any form became endemic
in the distressful city. A few years later (388 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) the poet gave in the
<i>Plutus</i> a pointed discussion<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> of economic questions, ridiculing the notion
that all could be rich at the same time: for nobody would work, and
so civilization would come to an end. True, the individualistic bent of
the average Athenian, grasping and litigious, prevented the establishment
of downright communism: but Athens was henceforth never free
from the jealous and hardly patriotic demands of the clamorous poor
We must remember that military service, no longer offering prospects
of profit in addition to pay, was becoming unpopular; that land-allotments<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
in conquered territories had ceased; and that agriculture
in a large part of Attica was toilsome and unremunerative. Poverty
was widespread, and commerce declined: this implies that the supply
of slaves, and the money to buy them, would be reduced. Was there
then much to attract the poor man to the lonely tillage of a patch of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
rocky land? The generation of small farmers before and during the
great war had some outlook for themselves and their sons, serving in
victorious armies or fleets, getting booty or allotments abroad. Hence
they took a keen interest in politics. The fall of Athens had changed
all this: the profits of empire had departed, and with them the buoyancy
of an imperial pride. No wonder if there were signs of unwillingness
to follow a hard rustic life. So the Informer in the <i>Plutus</i><a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, when
asked ‘are you a husbandman?’ replies ‘do you take me for a madman?’
Earlier in the play<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Chremylus, wishing to share with old cronies
the profits of having captured the god of wealth, says to his slave
‘invite my fellow farmers: I fancy you’ll find them working themselves
(αὐτοὺς) on their farms.’</p>

<p>I have taken this later picture first, in order to bring out more
clearly the contrast presented by that given in the earlier plays. Naturally
enough, many details are the same in both, but the general character
of the farmers is different. The farmer class makes an important figure.
They are sturdy rustics<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, old-fashioned and independent, rough in
manners, fond of simple country life, and inclined (perhaps justly) to
mistrust the city folk, who cheat them in business whenever they can,
and take advantage of them in other ways, such as liability to military
service at short notice. When driven to take refuge in Athens,
their hearts are in their farms, and they have to make up their minds
whether to support the war-party in hope of regaining their homes and
property by force of arms, or to press for peace in order to end what
is from their point of view an unnecessary war, kept going in the interest
of demagogues and others who are profiting by the opportunities
of offices and campaigns abroad. The issue appears in our earliest play,
the <i>Acharnians</i> (425 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>). The farmers of the deme Acharnae, one of
whose occupations was wood-cutting and charcoal-burning, at first
come on as stubborn rustics, all for war and revenge on the enemy.
But Dicaeopolis the chief character of the play, himself a farmer, and
a sufferer in the same kind by the Spartan raids, succeeds in persuading<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
them that Athenian policy, provocative and grasping, is really to blame
for their losses. In the end they come over to his views, and the play
serves as a manifesto of the peace-party. Of course we are not to take
it as history. But the conflict between the two sections of opinion is
probably real enough. When Dicaeopolis describes<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> himself as ‘with
my eyes ever turned to my farm, a lover of peace, detesting the city
and hankering after my own deme, that never yet bade me buy charcoal
or rough wine or olive oil,’ he is giving us a portrait of the rustic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
who is resolved not to part with cash for what can be produced on the
farm.</p>

<p>But, whatever policy may seem best adapted to achieve their purpose,
the purpose itself is clearly and consistently marked. The desire of
the war-time farmers is simply to return to their farms<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and to resume
the life of toil and plenty, varied by occasional festivals, that had been
interrupted by the war. They long to escape from the abominations
of the crowding and unhealthiness prevailing in the city. Once they
get back to their old surroundings, all will be well. Time and labour
will even repair the damages caused by the enemy. No misgivings
suggest that a change of circumstances may be found to have robbed
Attic country life of some of its charm. Nothing like the loss of the
empire, the fall of Athens, and the deadly depression of economic and
political life, is foreboded: they face the sequel with undisturbed faith
in the stability of the existing system. Nor indeed until the Sicilian
disaster (413 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) was there much to cause uneasiness. So we find the
same spirit illustrated in the <i>Peace</i> (421 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>), which may be regarded
as driving home the lesson of the <i>Acharnians</i>. The agricultural interests
are now represented as solidly in favour of the peace of Nicias, unsatisfactory
though it soon proved to be. While other interests are slack,
indifferent or even hostile, farmers are whole-hearted<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> in determination
to end the war and go home. Trygaeus their leader, according to the
Greek sketch of the plot an elderly rustic, describes himself<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> as a
‘skilled vine-dresser, one who is no informer or fomenter of troubles
(lawsuits).’ Needless to say, he carries his point, and the farmers march
off triumphant<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> to their farms, eager to take up the old easygoing life
once more. We must not take our comic poet too literally, but we have
no reason to doubt that feelings such as he depicts in this play did
prevail, and perhaps widely. And, though the peace was insincere, and
warfare never really ceased, the immunity of Attica from invasion for
several years gave time for agriculture to revive. When Agis occupied
Deceleia in the winter of 413, his marauders would find on the Attic
farms all manner of improvements and new plantations to destroy.
And the destruction of the fruits of a laborious revival is to be reckoned
among the depressing influences that weighed upon falling and desperate
Athens. It was surely at work in the year 411, when Aristophanes
was preaching a policy of concord at home and sympathetic treatment
of the Allies in order to save the shaken empire. In the <i>Lysistrata</i> he
represents the mad war-fury of the Greek states as due to the misguided
men, whom the women coerce by privation into willingness for peace.
This is strung up into a passionate longing, so that neither<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
principal parties is disposed to haggle over details. The Athenian
breaks out ‘I want to strip and work my land at once.’ The Spartan
rejoins ‘and I want to be carting manure.’ There is still no misgiving
expressed, and the poet is probably true to facts. The struggles of the
time were a fearful strain on Athenian resources, but it still seemed
possible that the empire would weather the storm.</p>

<p>This brief sketch leads on to the inquiry, what do we gather as to
the labour employed on the farms? We have to consider three possibilities
(<i>a</i>) the farmer, including his family, (<i>b</i>) hired labourers, (<i>c</i>) slaves.
It is well to begin by remarking that frequency of reference to one of
these does not necessarily imply the same proportion in actual employment.
Slavery being assumed as a fact in all departments of life (as it
is by all writers of the period), and the slave being an economic or
domestic appliance rather than a person, there was no need to call
special attention to his presence. Hence it is natural that the rustic
slave should, as such, be seldom referred to in the plays. He is in fact
mentioned several times, rather more often than the yoke of oxen. Nor
was it necessary to mention the wage-earner, the man employed for
the job under a temporary contract, and in connexion with agriculture
he hardly appears at all. But the working farmers were a class of
citizens. They had votes, and they were on political grounds a class
to whose sympathies the poet was anxious to appeal. Therefore he
had no choice but to lay stress upon their virtues and magnify their
importance. Any careful reader of Aristophanes will I think admit
that he does this consistently. In doing this with political aims he was
subject to the temptation of passing lightly over any considerations
that might, whether justly or unjustly, be turned against his case. This
may serve to explain why he refers almost solely to the small working
farmer, who himself labours on the land. We are not to infer that there
were no large estates worked by deputy, though probably there were
not many: to lay stress on the interested views of large landowners
was not likely to please the jealous Demos. Nor are we to infer that
the small farmer used no slaves: that he laboured himself is no proof,
for no man could get more out of a slave’s labour than the working
owner, on whom the burden of making good his slave’s neglect must
fall. I turn now to the passages from which the various details may
be gleaned.</p>

<p>In the <i>Acharnians</i> the working farmer Dicaeopolis is delighted at
having made a separate peace on his own account. He holds it a fine
thing<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> that he should now be able to perform religious rites and
celebrate the festival of the rustic Dionysia with his slaves. He is back
at home<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> in his own rural deme, and he calls his slave Xanthias to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
carry the phallus in the procession. In the <i>Clouds</i><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> old Strepsiades says
that he lives in the heart of the country, and his preference for the easy
and rather squalid life on a farm is plainly expressed. And the play
opens with his complaint that in war-time a man has not a free hand
to punish his slaves. It is however not clear that he is supposed to be
at the time living on the farm. In the <i>Wasps</i> the chorus of old dicasts
are indignant<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> that their old comrade Philocleon should be dragged
off by his own slaves at the order of his son. The old man himself,
struggling and protesting, reminds the leading slave of the time when
he caught the rogue stealing grapes (obviously in his vineyard) and
thrashed him soundly. In the <i>Peace</i> a rustic scene<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> is described. The
weather being unfavourable for work on the land, but excellent for the
seed just sown, it is proposed to make merry indoors. Country fare is
made ready, and the female slave Syra is told to call in the man slave
Manes from the farm. A little below Trygaeus is mocking the workers
in war-trades. To the trumpet-maker he says, fit up your trumpet
differently<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and you can turn it into a weighing-machine: ‘it will then
do for serving out rations of figs to your slaves on the farm.’ In the
<i>Lysistrata</i> the chorus, being aware that an interval of distress will
follow the conclusion of peace, offers<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> to tide over the crisis by helping
the fathers of large families and owners of hungry slaves by doles of
food. ‘Let them bring their bags and wallets for wheat: my Manes
shall fill them.’ After these passages the announcement of the working
of the communistic scheme<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i> carries us into a very
different atmosphere. ‘But who is to till the soil under the new order?’
asks Blepyrus. ‘Our slaves,’ replies Praxagora, his typical better-half.
We see that this amounts to basing society on a serf-system, for the
slaves will be common property like the rest. In the <i>Plutus</i> old Chremylus
is a farmer, apparently a working<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> farmer, but he has a slave,
indeed more than one. Age has probably led him to do most of his
work by deputy. When Poverty, in the course of her economic lecture,
explains to him<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> that wealth for all means slaves for none and that
he will have to plough and dig for his own proper sustenance, he is indignant.
The weak points of the argument do not concern us here. The
solution offered in the play, the cure of the Wealth-god’s blindness,
enabling him to enrich only the deserving, is a mere piece of sportive
nonsense, meant to amuse an audience, not to hold out a serious hope
of better things.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to shew that the slave had a place in farm
life as depicted by Aristophanes. It will be observed that in the earlier
plays the references are all of a casual kind: that is to say, that slave-labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
calls for no particular attention or remark. The consideration
of slave-labour as such, in fact as an economic phenomenon, only
appears later. This is, I repeat, significant of the change that had come
upon Athens and Attica in consequence of exhaustion. In respect of
hired labour it is obvious that pressure of poverty, as stated<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> in the
<i>Plutus</i>, directly influences the supply. If the possession of a competency
will deter men from professional industry in trades, even more
will it deter them from the drudgery of rough labour. The hired men
(μισθωτοί) were commonly employed in all departments, for instance
in the building trades, to which there is a reference<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> in the <i>Birds</i>. But
we may fairly assume that during the great war the number of such
‘hands’ available for civilian services was much reduced. In agriculture
there would be little or no demand for them. And any able-bodied
citizen could earn good pay from the state. Moreover rough labour
was not much to the taste of the average Athenian,—above all, digging<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.
‘I cannot dig’ was proverbial. On the other hand there were farm-duties
in the performance of which sufficient care and intelligence
could only be exacted through the medium of wage-paying. Such was
that of olive-pickers, to whom and their wage we have a reference<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> in the
<i>Wasps</i>. They are probably free persons, but it is possible that wage-earning
slaves, paying rent to their owners, might be thus employed.
That in some occupations free and slave-labour were both employed
indifferently, is certain. The carriage of burdens<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> is a case in point.
But employment in odd jobs would be far more frequent in the city,
including Peiraeus, than in country places. I do not think it rash to
conclude that hired free labourers were few on the farms of Attica in
the time of Aristophanes.</p>

<p>Turning to citizen agriculturists, it must be mentioned that views
differ as to the proportion of large estates held and worked by wealthy
owners in this period. Such estates would almost certainly employ
slave-labour. So far as the evidence of Aristophanes goes, I should
infer that they were few. No doubt he had reasons for not making
much of such cases; still I believe that the comfortable working farmer,
homely and independent, the poet’s favourite character, was in fact the
normal type. They were not paupers,—far from it: but their capital
consisted in land, buildings, dead and live farm-stock, and the unexhausted
value of previous cultivation. These items could not suddenly
be converted into money without ruinous loss: most of them could
not be carried away in the flight to Athens. Hence the dislike felt
by such men to an adventurous policy, in which their interests were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
sacrificed. The passages in which agriculture is connected<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> with large
property occur in a play produced 392 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, at which time great changes
had happened. It is highly probable that, among these changes, much
Attic land had passed from the hands of ruined yeomen into those of
rich men possessed of ready money and able to buy in a glutted market.
In a later period we shall find γεωργεῖν used in the sense of acting the
country landowner. To illustrate the life and ways of the peasant
farmers of this period Aristophanes supplies endless references descriptive
and allusive. The chief of these have been cited above. A few
more may be added here. In the <i>Clouds</i> Strepsiades, urging his son to
a rustic life, hopes to see him dressed in a leathern jerkin, like his
father before him, driving in the goats<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> from the waste (φελλέως, the
rocky hill-pasture). Here is a good instance of husbandry in the Attic
highlands, in short a case of crofters. What a refugee might hope to
save in his flight and take back to his farm on the return of peace—it
amounts to a few implements<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>—is set out in the <i>Peace</i>. Loss of oxen,
a yoke of two, driven off by Boeotian raiders, is pitifully bewailed<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> by
a farmer in the <i>Acharnians</i>. But in general the farmers of the earlier
plays are represented as tough elderly men. They are the ‘elder
generation,’ and the poet genuinely admires them. For the younger
generation he has a profound contempt. Evidently he thought that
the soundest breed of Athenian citizens was dying out; and I am not
sure that he was wrong.</p>

<p>I conclude that the evidence of Aristophanes on the whole points
to an agriculture mainly carried on by working farmers with the help
of slaves. This system was subjected to a very severe strain by the
war-conditions prevailing for many years, and I do not think that it
was possible to revive it on the same footing as before, even when
Attica was no longer exposed to frequent raids. It was not merely the
loss of fixed capital that told on the farmer class. Importation of corn
was so developed and organized to meet the necessities of the crowded
city, that it completely dominated the market, and in the production
of cereals the home agriculture could now no longer compete with
foreign harvests. There remained the culture of the olive and vine:
but it needed years to restore plantations of these and other fruit-trees,
and to wait for revival needed a capital possessed by few. The loss of
imperial revenues impoverished Athens, and the struggle with financial
difficulties runs through all her later history. It did not take the
poorer citizens long to see that how to get daily bread was the coming
problem. State-pay was no longer plentiful, and one aim of jealous
franchise-regulations was to keep down the number of claimants. Had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Aristophanes any inkling of the evil days to come? At all events he
was aware that poverty works in two<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> ways: if it leads one man to
practise a trade for his living, it tempts another to evildoing, perhaps
to crime.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XI">XI. THUCYDIDES.</h3>

<p><b>Thucydides</b> is a writer from whom it is extremely difficult to
extract any evidence on the subject of agricultural labour. The preeminent
importance of the problem of food-supply in the Greece of his
day may be amply illustrated from his work; but mainly in casual
utterances, the full significance of which is only to be gathered by
thorough examination such as has been made<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> by Dr Grundy. The
economic revolution in Attica that followed the reforms of Solon, the
extended culture of the vine and olive, the reduced growth of cereal
crops, the development of manufactures and sea-borne trade, the
growing dependence on imported corn, and the influence of these
changes on the public policy of Athens, are now seen more clearly as
a whole than ever before. But to the great historian these things were
part of the background of his picture. They are parts of a movement
taken for granted rather than understood. And the same is true of
the existence and application of slave-labour. In the time of Thucydides
slavery was an economic and social fact, unchallenged. It may
be that it affected unfavourably the position of the free handworker in
the long run, and gave opportunities to slaveowning capitalists. But
this effect came about slowly, and freeman and slave could and did
labour<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> side by side, for instance in the great public works promoted
by Pericles. How far slave-labour was really cheaper than free is a
question beyond my subject. But it is important to note the attitude
of the poor citizen towards the question of what we call a living wage.
Once the great outlay on public works began to fall off, and industries
on a larger scale to compete with the individual craftsman, how was
the poor citizen to live? Directly or indirectly, the profits of empire
supplied the answer. Now it was obvious that the fewer the beneficiaries
the larger would be the average dividend of each. So the policy
favoured by the poorer classes was a jealous restriction of the franchise.
It was not the slave as labour-competitor against whom protection was
desired, but the resident freeman of doubtful origin as a potential
profit-sharer.</p>

<p>During nearly the whole of the period covered by the history of
Thucydides the public policy of Athens was controlled by urban influences.
Even before the rustic citizens were cooped up in the city, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
was no doubt city residents that formed the normal majority in the
Assembly, and to whom most of the paid offices and functions fell.
Even allowing for the recent growth of ‘seafaring rabble’ in Peiraeus,
these Athenians were not at all a mere necessitous mob. But it must
be remembered that the commercial and industrial capitalists were
interested in foreign trade. As Mr Cornford<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> points out, even metics of
this class must have had considerable influence owing to wealth and
connexions. Thus the urban rich as well as the urban poor were
tempted to favour a policy of adventure, contrary to the wishes and
interests of the Attic farmers. Now these latter were the truest representatives
of the old Attic stock. Once they were crowded into the
city and many of them diverted to state service, any sobering influence
that they might at first exercise would become less and less marked,
and they would tend to be lost in the mass. Therefore we hear only
of the rustic life<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> from which they unwillingly tore themselves in 431 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>:
we do not get any detailed picture of it, for the historian’s attention
was otherwise occupied. In the passage<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> accounting for the unpopularity
of Pericles in 430 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> we read that the Demos was irritated because
‘having less (than the rich) to start with, it had been deprived of that
little,’ while the upper class (δυνατοὶ) had lost their fine establishments.
Here the context seems to imply that the δῆμος referred to is especially
the small farmers, still dwelling on their losses and not yet otherwise
employed.</p>

<p>One passage is so important that it must be discussed by itself.
Pericles is made to encourage<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> the Athenians in resistance to the
Spartan demands by pointing out the superiority of their resources
compared with those of the enemy. ‘The Peloponnesians’ he says ‘are
working farmers (αὐτουργοί). They have no store of wealth (χρήματα)
either private or public. Nor have they experience of protracted warfare
with operations beyond the sea: for their own campaigns against
each other are short, owing to poverty.’ After explaining how they
must be hampered by lack of means, he resumes thus ‘And working
farmers are more ready to do service in person than by payment. They
trust that they may have the luck to survive the perils of war; but
they have no assurance that their means will not be exhausted before
it ends: for it may drag out to an unexpected length—and this is likely
to happen.’ Two questions at once suggest themselves. Is this a fair
sketch of agricultural conditions in Peloponnese? Does it imply that
Attic farmers were not αὐτουργοί? To take the latter first, it is held
by Professor Beloch<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> that the passage characterizes the Peloponnese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
as a land of free labour, in contrast with slave-holding Athens. To this
view I cannot assent. I am convinced that the Attic farmer who worked
with his own hands did often, if not always, employ slave-labour also.
He would not have a large gang of slaves, like the large-scale cultivator:
he could not afford to keep an overseer. But it might pay him to keep
one or two slaves, not more than he could oversee himself. If the contrast
be clearly limited, so as to compare the wealth of Athens, now largely industrial
and commercial, with the wealth of a purely agricultural population,
scattered over a wide area, and having little ready money, it is
reasonable and true. But this does not raise the question of the Attic
farmer at all. A little below<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Pericles is made to urge that class to
submit quietly to invasion and serious loss. They are not the people
on whose resources he relies to wear out the enemy. That enemy finds
it hard to combine for common action or to raise money by war-taxes.
Athens is a compact community, able to act quickly, and has at disposal
the forces and tribute of her subjects, secured by naval supremacy.
To the other question, that of Peloponnesian agriculture, I see no
simple answer. All the southern parts, the region of Spartan helotry,
can hardly be called a land of free labour in any rational sense. Nor
does it appear that Argolis, in spite of the various revolutions in local
politics, could rightly be described thus. Elis and Achaia were hardly
of sufficient importance to justify such a general description, even if it
were certain that it would apply to them locally. Arcadia, mostly
mountainous and backward, is the district to which the description
would be most applicable. But that there were slaves in Arcadia is
not only probable but attested by evidence, later in date but referring
to an established<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> state of things. At festivals, we are told, slaves and
masters shared the same table. This does not exclude rustic slaves: it
rather seems to suggest them. The working farmer entertaining his
slaves on a rural holiday is even a conventional tradition of ancient
country life. Arcadia, a land of peasant farmers, where a living had to
be won by hard work, a land whence already in the fifth century (and
still more in the fourth) came numbers of mercenary soldiers, a land
whence Sparta raised no small part of her ‘Peloponnesian’ armies, is
what Pericles has chiefly in mind. And that Arcadians were normally
αὐτουργοὶ did not imply that they had no slaves.</p>

<p>So far as Attica is concerned, Thucydides himself incidentally
attests the presence of rustic slaves. He would probably have been,
surprised to hear such an obvious fact questioned. In refusing to repeal
the ‘Megarian decree’ the Athenians charged<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> the Megarians with
various offences, one of which was the reception of their runaway slaves.
In the winter 415-4 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> Alcibiades, urging the Spartans to occupy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Deceleia, is made to state<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> the advantages of that move thus ‘For of
all the farm-stock in the country the bulk will at once come into your
possession, some by capture, and the rest of its own accord (αὐτόματα).’
I take the last words to refer especially to slaves,—rustic slaves. In
recording the success of the plan, the historian tells<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> us that more than
20000 slaves, a large part of whom were artisans (χειροτέχναι), deserted
to the enemy. We may guess that many or most of the artisan slaves
had escaped from Athens. Their loss would be felt in the reduction of
manufacturing output, so far as such enterprise was still possible at the
time, and perhaps in the dockyards. But the rest would be rustic slaves,
many of them (to judge by the map) from a district<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> in which there
were probably many small farms. On the other hand, the slaves welcomed
by the Megarians were probably from larger estates in the
Thriasian plain. Turning from Attica, we find references to rustic slaves<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
in Corcyra (427 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) and Chios (412 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>), where they were numerous
and important in their effect on operations. And in other passages
where the slaves belonging to the people of this or that place are mentioned
we are not to assume that only urban slaves are meant. For to
live in a town, and go out for the day’s work on the land, was and is
a common usage in Mediterranean countries. An extreme case<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> is
where people live on an island and cross water to cultivate farms elsewhere.
It is perhaps hardly necessary to remark that rich slaveowners,
who could afford overseers, did not need to reside permanently on their
estates. Such a man might have more than one farm, and in more than
one district, not necessarily in Attica at all, as Thucydides himself
exploited a mining concession in Thrace. In any case a well-equipped
‘country place’ was a luxury, and is characterized as such<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> in words
put into the mouth of Pericles, who as the democratic statesman was
concerned to stifle discontent by insinuating that it was a mere expression
of the selfishness of the rich.</p>

<p>The settlement of Athenians in colonies (ἀποικίαι) or on allotments
of conquered land (κληρουχίαι), in the islands or on the seaboard has
been fully treated<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> by Dr Grundy. He shews that this movement had
two aims, the occupation of strategic points as an imperial measure of
security, and the provision of land-lots for poorer citizens as a measure
of economic relief. The latter purpose is part of a general plan for
reducing the financial liabilities of the state with respect to its citizen
population, the necessity for which Dr Grundy explains. By these
settlements abroad some surplus population was removed and provided
with means of livelihood. If the assumption of a surplus citizen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
population be sound (and I am not in a position to challenge it), we must
also assume a certain degree of genuine land-hunger, at least more
than the Attic territory could satisfy. If there was such land-hunger,
it is perhaps not unreasonable to connect it with the survival of old
Attic traditions of country life. And it would seem that the settlers,
cleruchs or colonists, did as a rule<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> stay and live in their settlements.
They would probably work their lands on much the same general plan
as their brethren in Attica, and their labour-arrangements would be
much the same. But in 427 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, when Pericles was dead and there was
surely no surplus population, at least of able-bodied men, owing to the
war, we find a curious record. Reconquered Lesbos<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> had to be dealt
with. It was not subjected to an assessed tribute (φόρος), but parcelled
into 3000 allotments, 2700 of which were reserved for 2700 Athenian
citizens, those who drew the lucky lots (τοὺς λαχόντας), and these 2700
were sent out. But they did not stay<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> there. They let their shares to
the old inhabitants as cultivating tenants, at a rent of two minae per
share per annum, and evidently returned to Athens. By this arrangement
a sum of about £21000 a year would come in to the shareholders
in Athens, who would have a personal interest in seeing that it was
punctually paid. Whether these non-resident landlords were chosen
by lot from all citizens, rich or poor, is not stated. We know that in
some cases<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> at least the choice of settlers was confined to members
of the two lowest property-classes; and it may well be that on this
occasion the opportunity<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> was taken to compensate to some extent
members of rural families, who had suffered loss from the invasions of
Attica, but did not wish to go abroad. In any case their tenants would
farm as they had done before, employing or not employing slave labour
according to their means and the circumstances of the several farms.
So too in cases of lands let on lease, and in the confiscations and redistributions
of lands, proposed or carried out, it was simply their own
profit and comfort that attracted the lessees or beneficiaries. We are
entitled to assume that if it paid to employ slaves, and slaves were to
be had, then slaves were employed. In short, the scraps of evidence
furnished by Thucydides leave us pretty much where we were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XII">XII. XENOPHON.</h3>

<p><b>Xenophon</b>, who lived somewhere between 440 and 350 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, introduces
us to a great change in the conditions of the Greek world. The
uneasiness and sufferings of the Greek states from the fall of Athens
in 404 to the time of exhaustion resulting from the battle of Mantinea
in 362 do not concern us here. Of such matters we hear much, but
very little directly of the economic changes that were undoubtedly
going on. Poverty was as before a standing trouble in Greece. In the
more backward parts<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> able-bodied men left their homes to serve as
hired soldiers. The age of professional mercenaries was in full swing.
Arcadians Achaeans Aetolians Acarnanians Thessalians and other
seekers after fortune became more and more the staple material of
armies. Athens could no longer support imperial ambitions on imperial
tributes, and had to depend on the sale of her products to procure
her supplies of food. These products were chiefly oil and wine
and urban manufactures, and there is reason to think that in general
the most economical method of production was by slave labour under
close and skilful superintendence. Slaves were supplied by kidnappers
from the Euxine and elsewhere, but prisoners captured by armies were
another source of supply. This living loot was one of the perquisites
that made military life attractive, and the captives found their way to
such markets as the industrial centres of Athens and Corinth. What
happened in the rural districts of Attica, how far there was a revival
of the small farmer class, is a point on which we are very much in the
dark. The indirect evidence of Xenophon is interesting but not wholly
conclusive.</p>

<p>It is perhaps important to consider what significance should be
attached to the mention of agricultural work done by men of military
forces on land or sea. In 406 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> we hear of hardships<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> endured by
the force under the Spartan Eteonicus who were cut off in Chios after
the defeat of Arginusae. During the summer months they ‘supported
themselves on the fruits of the season and by working for hire in the
country.’ This is meant to shew that they were in sad straits, as the
sequel clearly proves. Again, in 372 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> Iphicrates was with a force
in Corcyra, and naval operations were for the time over. So he
‘managed<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> to provide for his oarsmen (νάυτας) chiefly by employing
them in farm-work for the Corcyraeans,’ while he undertook an expedition
on the mainland with his soldiers. In both these cases want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of pay was no doubt one reason for emergency-labour. In the earlier
case the destitution of the men led them to look for any paid work:
in the second the general had to do his best in spite of irregular and
insufficient supplies from home. In both cases it is the exceptional
nature of the arrangement that makes it worth mentioning. It can
hardly be viewed as having any economic significance. But it is of
some interest in connexion with a passage of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> that will require
notice below.</p>

<p>In the <i>Anabasis</i> Xenophon reports his own arguments, urging the
Greek army to fight their way out of the Persian empire. He feared
that, now Cyrus was dead, and they were cut off far from home in an
enemy’s country, they might in despair surrender to the King and
take service under him. At best this meant giving up Greece and
settling in Persia on the King’s terms. This he begged them not to
do: that they could under Greek discipline cut their way out was
evident from the independence of many peoples of Asia Minor, who
lived and raided as they chose in defiance of the Persian power. He
added ‘Therefore I hold<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> that our right and proper course is first to
make a push to reach Hellas and our own kinsmen, and to demonstrate
to the Greeks that their poverty is their own fault: for, if they would
only convey to these parts those of their citizens who are now living
in want at home, they could see them in plenty (πλουσίους).’ But he
reminds them that the good things of Asia are only to be had as the
reward of victory. For my present purpose the one important point
is that a mixed host of Greek mercenaries are said to have been
appealed to by a reference to the fact of poverty and land-hunger
among their folks at home, and that this reference is said to have been
made by an Athenian. Writing this in later life, Xenophon would
hardly have set down such an argument had it not then, as on the
occasion recorded, had considerable force. In another passage<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> he
gives an interesting account of the motives that had induced most of
the men to join the expedition. He is explaining why they were irritated
at a rumour that they were to be pressed to settle down at a
spot on the Euxine coast. ‘It was not lack of subsistence that had led
most of the soldiers to go abroad on this paid service: they had been
told of the generosity of Cyrus. Some had other men following them,
some had even spent money for the cause: others had run away
from their parents, or left children behind, meaning to win money
and return to them, on the faith of the reported prosperity of those
already in the service of Cyrus. Such was the character of the men,
and they were longing to get safe home to Greece.’ In short, full-blooded
men were not content to drag on poor ill-found stagnant lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
in corners of Greece. And we may add that nothing stimulated the
enterprises of Greek adventurers in the East, and led up to the conquests
of Alexander, more effectually than the experiences of the Ten
Thousand.</p>

<p>Among these experiences was of course the capture of booty, more
particularly<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> in the form of marketable prisoners. So many of these
were sometimes in hand that they were a drag on the march: in a
moment of peril<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> they had to be abandoned. Even so, a considerable
sum had been raised by sales<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and was shared out at Cerasus. The
Greek cities on the Pontic seaboard would all no doubt be resorts of
slave-dealers. One of the Ten Thousand himself, formerly a slave<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> at
Athens, recognized as kinsmen by their speech the people of a mountain
tribe in Armenia. In Thrace too we hear of the chieftain Seuthes,
when short of cash, offering<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> to make a payment partly in slaves. Nor
was selling into slavery a fate reserved for barbarians alone. Greeks<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
had been treated thus in the great war lately ended; and now the
Spartan harmost, anxious to clear the remainder of the Ten Thousand<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
out of Byzantium safely, made them an offer of facilities for a raid in
Thrace: any that stayed behind in the town were to be sold as slaves.
And more than 400 were accordingly sold. It seems reasonable to infer
that at this time the slave-markets were as busy as ever, perhaps more
so than had been the case during the great war. It may be going too far
to say that in some parts of Greece people were now trying to restore
a broken prosperity by industrial exploitation of slave-labour, while
from other parts soldiers of fortune and kidnappers went forth to enlarge
the supply of slaves. But that there is some truth in such a statement
I do not doubt. It was evidently no easy matter for persons of
small means to live in any sort of comfort at Athens. We hear of
Socrates<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> discussing with a friend the embarrassments of a genteel
household. The late civil disorders have driven a number of this man’s
sisters cousins and aunts to take refuge in his house. In the present
state of things neither land nor house property are bringing in anything,
and nobody will lend. How is he to maintain a party of 14 free
persons in all? Socrates points to the case of a neighbour who provides
for a still larger household without difficulty. Questions elicit the fact
that this household consists of slave-artisans trained to useful trades.
The distressed party have been brought up as ladies, to do nothing.
Socrates suggests that they had better work for bread than starve.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
The adoption of this suggestion produced the happiest results in every
way. Such was the way in which Socrates led his friend. He drew
from him the assertion that free people are superior to slaves, and so
brought him round to the conviction that superiority could not be
shewn by mere incapacity for work.</p>

<p>In this conversation of Socrates may be detected the germ of a
complete revolution in thought on labour-subjects. It avoids the topic
of common humanity. That the slave is a man and brother, only the
victim of misfortune, had been hinted by Euripides and was to become
a theme of comic poets. But Socrates lets this point alone, and argues
from natural economic necessity. Elsewhere he denounces<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> idleness
and proclaims that useful labour is good for the labourer, taking a
moral point of view. Again, he suggests<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> that the shortcomings of
slaves are largely due to their masters’ slackness or mismanagement.
But he accepts slavery as a social and economic fact. All the same he
makes play at times with the notion of moral worthlessness, which
many people regarded as characteristic of slaves in general. It is the
knowledge of the true qualities<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> of conduct, in short of the moral and
political virtues, that makes men honourable gentlemen (καλοὺς
κἀγαθούς), and the lack of this knowledge that makes them slavish
(ἀνδραποδώδεις). But, if the difference between a liberal and an illiberal
training, expressed in resulting habits of mind, is thus great, the slavish
must surely include many of those legally free. Hence he even goes
so far as to say ‘Therefore we ought to spare no exertions to escape
being slaves (ἀνδράποδα).’ And he lays stress on the need of moral
qualities<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> in slaves as well as freemen: we should never be willing to
entrust our cattle or our store-houses or the direction of our works to
a slave devoid of self-control. His position suggests two things: first,
that the importance of the slave in the economic and social system
was a striking fact now recognized: second, that the unavoidable moral
degradation generally assumed to accompany the condition of slavery
was either wrongfully assumed or largely due to the shortcomings of
masters. The conception of the slave as a mere chattel, injury to which
is simply a damage to its owner, was proving defective in practice, and
the philosopher was inclined to doubt its soundness in principle.
Xenophon had been brought into touch with such questionings by his
intercourse with Socrates. It remains to see how far he shews traces
of their influence when he comes to treat labour-problems in connexion
with agriculture.</p>

<p>References to agriculture<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
    are few and unimportant in the <i>Memorabilia</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
The <i>Economicus</i> deals directly with the subject. A significant
passage throws light on the condition of rural Attica at the end of the
fifth century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. The speaker Ischomachus tells<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> how his father made
money by judicious enterprise. He bought up farms that were let down
or derelict, got them into good order, and sold them at a profit when
improved. Clearly he was a citizen, able to deal in real estate, and a
capitalist. There can hardly be a doubt that he operated by the use
of slave-labour on a considerable scale. All through the <i>Economicus</i>
slavery is presupposed, but the attitude of Xenophon is characteristically
genial and humane. The existence of a slave-market<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, where you may
buy likely men, even skilled craftsmen, is assumed. But the most
notable feature of the book is the seriousness with which the responsibility
of the master<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> is asserted. There is no querulous evasion of the
issue by laying the blame of failure on the incorrigible vices of slaves.
Prosperity will depend on securing good service: good service cannot
be secured by any amount of chains and punishments, if the master be
slack and fitful: both in the house and on the farm, good sympathetic
discipline, fairly and steadily enforced, is the secret of success. Carelessness
malingering and desertion must be prevented or checked.
And to achieve this is the function of the economic art, operating
through the influence of hope rather than fear. The training of slaves<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
is a matter needing infinite pains on the part of the master and mistress.
She must train her housekeeper (ταμία) as he trains his steward
(ἐπίτροπος), and both are to act in a humane and kindly spirit. Yet
the strictly animal view of slaves<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> appears clearly in a passage where
the training of slaves is compared with that of horses or performing
dogs. ‘But it is possible to make men more obedient by mere instruction
(καὶ λόγῳ), pointing out that it is to their interest to obey: in
dealing with slaves the system which is thought suitable for training
beasts has much to recommend it as a way of teaching obedience. For
by meeting their appetites with special indulgence to their bellies you
may contrive to get much out of them.’ We gather that the better and
more refined type of Athenian gentleman with a landed estate, while
averse to inhumanity, and aware that slaves were human, still regarded
his slaves as mere chattels. His humanity is prompted mainly by self-interest.
As for rights, they have none.</p>

<p>The system of rewards and punishments on the estate of course
rests wholly on the masters will. The whole success of the working
depends on the efficiency of the steward or stewards. Accordingly the
passage in which Ischomachus explains how he deals with these trusted
slaves is of particular interest. Having carefully trained a man, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
must judge him<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> according to a definite standard—does he or does he
not honestly and zealously discharge his trust? ‘When I find that in
spite of good treatment they still try to cheat me, I conclude that their
greediness is past curing, and degrade them<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> from their charge.’ This
seems to mean that they are reduced to the position of the ordinary
hands. ‘But when I observe any induced to be honest<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> not merely because
honesty pays best, but because they want to get a word of praise
from me, these I treat as no longer slaves (ὥσπερ ἐλευθέροις ἤδη). I
not only enrich them, but shew them respect as men of honour.’ One
is tempted to interpret these last words as implying that actual manumission
takes place, the services of the men being retained as freedmen.
But the words do not say so plainly, and it is safer to read into them
no technical sense. That the men are trusted and allowed to earn for
themselves, is enough. The agriculture depicted in the <i>Economicus</i> is
that of a landowner with plenty of capital, not that of the peasant
farmer. The note of it is superintendence<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> (ἐπιμέλεια), not bodily
labour (αὐτουργία). In one place αὐτουργία is mentioned, when agriculture
is praised, one of its merits being the bodily strength that those
gain who work with their own hands. It is as well to repeat here that
the fact of a farmer labouring himself does not prove that he employs
no other labour. On the other hand there is good reason to infer that
the other class, those who ‘do their farming by superintendence,’ are
not manual labourers at all. The benefit to them is that agriculture
‘makes them early risers and smart in their movements.’ The master
keeps a horse, and is thus enabled to ride out<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> early to the farm and
stay there till late.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in this book we hear nothing of hired labourers.
There are two references<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> to the earning of pay, neither of them in
connexion with agricultural labour. Yet the existence of a class of
poor people who have to earn their daily bread<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> is not ignored.
Socrates admires the economic skill<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> of Ischomachus. It has enabled
him to be of service to his friends and to the state. This is a fine thing,
and shews the man of substance. In contrast, ‘there are numbers of
men who cannot live without depending on others: numbers too who
are content if they can procure themselves the necessaries of life.’ The
solid and strong men are those who contrive to make a surplus and
use it as benefactors. I read this passage as indirect evidence of the
depression of small-scale free industry and the increase of slaveowning
capitalism in the Athens of Xenophon’s time. And I find another indication<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
of this in connexion with agriculture. In the course of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
dialogue it appears that the chief points of agricultural knowledge are
simple enough: Socrates knew them all along. Why then do some
farmers succeed and others fail? The truth of the matter is, replies
Ischomachus, that the cause of failure is not want of knowledge but
want of careful superintendence. This criticism is in general terms,
but it is surely inapplicable to the case of the working peasant farmer:
he who puts his own labour into the land will not overlook the shortcomings
of a hired man or a slave. In the agriculture of which this
book treats it is the practical and intelligent self-interest of the master
that rules everything. His appearance on the field<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> should cause all
the slaves to brighten up and work with a will: but rather to win his
favour than to escape his wrath. For in agriculture, as in other pursuits,
the ultimate secret of success<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> is a divine gift, the power of inspiring a
willing obedience.</p>

<p>I have kept back one passage which needs to be considered with
reference to the steward<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. Can we safely assume that an ἐπίτροπος was
always, or at least normally, a slave? Of those who direct the labourers,
the real treasure is the man who gets zealous and steady work out of
the hands, whether he be steward or director (ἐπίτροπος or ἐπιστάτης).
What difference is connoted by these terms? In the <i>Memorabilia</i><a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>,
Socrates meets an old friend who is impoverished by the results of the
great war, and driven to earn his living by bodily labour. Socrates
points out to him that this resource will fail with advancing age: he
had better find some employment less dependent on bodily vigour.
‘Why not look out for some wealthy man who needs an assistant in
superintendence of his property? Such a man would find it worth his
while to employ you as director (or foreman, ἔργων ἐπιστατοῦντα), to
help in getting in his crops and looking after his estate.’ He answers
‘it would gall me to put up with a servile position (δουλείαν).’ Clearly
the position of ἐπιστάτης appears to him a meaner occupation than
free wage-earning by manual labour. In another place<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> we hear of an
ἐπιστάτης for a mine-gang being bought for a talent (£235). That
superintendents, whatever their title, were at least normally slaves,
seems certain. As to the difference between ‘steward’ and ‘director’
I can only guess that the former might be a slave promoted from
the ranks, but might also be what the ‘director’ always was, a new
importation. It seems a fair assumption that, as a free superintendent
must have been a new importation, a specially bought slave ‘director’
would rank somewhat higher than an ordinary ‘steward,’ whose title<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
ἐπίτροπος at once marked him as a slave. In relation to the general
employment of slave-labour there is practically no difference: both are
slave-driving ‘overseers.’ As the pamphlet on the Revenues has been
thought by some critics not to be the work of Xenophon, I pass it by,
only noting that it surely belongs to the same generation. It fully attests
the tendency to rely<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> on slave-labour, but it is not concerned with
agriculture.</p>

<p>The romance known as <i>Cyropaedia</i> wanders far from fact. Its
purpose is to expound or suggest Xenophon’s own views on the government
of men: accordingly opportunities for drawing a moral are sought
at the expense of historical truth. But from my present point of view
the chief point to note is that it does not touch the labour-question
with which we are concerned. True, we hear<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> of αὐτουργοί, and of the
hardship and poverty of such cultivators, gaining a painful livelihood
from an unkind soil. That the value of a territory depends on the
presence of a population<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> able and willing to develop its resources, is
fully insisted on by Cyrus. But this is in connexion with conquest.
The inhabitants of a conquered district remain as tributary cultivators,
merely changing their rulers. That the labour of the conquered is to
provide the sustenance of the conquering race, is accepted as a fundamental
principle. It is simply the right of the stronger: if he leaves
anything to his subject, that is a voluntary act of grace. The reason
why we hear little of slavery is that all are virtually slaves save the
one autocrat. The fabric of Xenophon’s model government is a very
simple one: first, an oriental Great King, possessed of all the virtues:
second, a class of warrior nobles, specially trained and dependent on
the King’s favour: third, a numerous subject population, whose labour
supports the whole, and who are practically serfs. A cynical passage<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
describes the policy of Cyrus, meant to perpetuate the difference of
the classes. After detailing minutely the liberal training enjoined on
those whom he intended to employ in governing (οὓς ... ἄρχειν ᾤετο
χρῆναι), Xenophon proceeds to those whom he intended to qualify
for servitude (οὓς ... κατεσκεύαζεν εἰς τὸ δουλεύειν). These it was his
practice not to urge to any of the liberal exercises, nor to allow them
to possess arms. He took great care to spare them any privations:
for instance at a hunt: the hunters had to take their chance of hunger
and thirst, being freemen, but the beaters had ample supplies and
halted for meals. They were delighted with this consideration, the
design of which was to prevent their ever ceasing to be slaves
(ἀνδράποδα). The whole scheme is frankly imperial. All initiative and
power rests with the autocrat, and all depends on his virtues. That a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
succession of such faultless despots could not be ensured, and that
the scheme was consequently utopian, did not trouble the simple
Xenophon. Like many other thoughtful men of the time, he was impressed
by the apparent efficiency of the rigid Spartan system, and
distrusted the individual liberty enjoyed in democratic states, above
all in Athens. In Persia, though he thought the Persians were no
longer what Cyrus the Great had made them, he had seen how great
was still the power arising from the control of all resources by a single
will. These two impressions combined seem to account for the tone
of the <i>Cyropaedia</i>, and the servile position of the cultivators explains
why it has so very little bearing on the labour-question in agriculture.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIII">XIII. THE COMIC FRAGMENTS.</h3>

<p>In pursuing our subject from period to period, and keeping so far
as possible to chronological order, it may seem inconsistent to take
this collection<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> of scraps as a group. For Attic Comedy covers nearly
two centuries, from the age of Cratinus to the age of Menander. Many
changes happened in this time, and the evidence of the fragments must
not be cited as though it were that of a single witness. But the
relevant passages are few; for the writers, such as Athenaeus and
Stobaeus, in whose works most of the extracts are preserved, seldom
had their attention fixed on agriculture. The longer fragments<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> of
Menander recently discovered are somewhat more helpful. The
adaptations of Plautus and Terence must be dealt with separately.</p>

<p>That country life and pursuits had their share of notice on the
comic stage is indicated by the fact that Aristophanes produced a
play<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> named Γεωργοί, and Menander a Γεωργός. That the slave-market
was active is attested by references in all periods. So too is
wage-earning labour of various kinds: but some of these passages
certainly refer to wage-earning by slaves paying a rent (ἀποφορά) to
their owners. Also the problems arising out of the relation between
master and slave, with recognition of the necessity of wise management.
The difference between the man who does know how to control
slaves<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and the man who does not (εὔδουλος and κακόδουλος) was
early expressed, and indirectly alluded to throughout. The good and
bad side of slaves, loyalty treachery honesty cheating etc, is a topic
constantly handled. But these passages nearly always have in view
the close relation of domestic slavery. I think we are justified in
inferring that the general tone steadily becomes more humane.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Common humanity gains recognition as a guide of conduct. Many of
the fragments have been handed down as being neatly put moral
sentences, and of these not a few<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> recognize the debt that a slave owes
to a good master. These are utterances of slaves, for the slave as a
character became more and more a regular figure of comedy, as comedy
became more and more a drama of private life. Side by side with this
tone is the frank recognition of the part played by chance<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> in the
destinies of master and slave; a very natural reflexion in a state
of things under which you had but to be captured and sold out of
your own country, out of the protection of your own laws, to pass
from the former condition to the latter. A few references to manumission
also occur, and the Roman adaptations suggest that in the later
Comedy they were frequent. On the other hand several fragments
seem to imply that circumstances were working unfavourably to the
individual free craftsmen, at least in some trades. The wisdom of
learning a craft (τέχνη), as a resource<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> that cannot be lost like external
possessions, is insisted on. But in other passages a more despairing
view<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> appears; death is better than the painful struggle for life. No doubt
different characters were made to speak from different points of view.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that two fragments of the earlier Comedy refer to
the old tradition<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> of a golden age long past, in which there were no
slaves (see under Herodotus), and in which the bounty of nature<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> provided
an ample supply of food and all good things (see the passages
cited from the <i>Odyssey</i>). Athenaeus, who has preserved<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> these extracts,
remarks that the old poets were seeking by their descriptions to accustom
mankind to do their own work with their own hands (αὐτουργοὺς
εἶναι). But it is evident that the subject was treated in the broadest
comic spirit, as his numerous quotations shew. When in the restoration
of good old times the articles of food are to cook and serve themselves
and ask to be eaten, we must not take the picture very seriously.
These passages do however suggest that there was a food-question at
the time when they were written, of sufficient importance to give point
to them: possibly also a labour-question. Now Crates and Pherecrates
flourished before the Peloponnesian war and during its earlier years,
Nicophon was a late contemporary of Aristophanes. The evidence is
too slight to justify a far-reaching conclusion, but it is consistent with
the general inferences drawn from other authorities. In the fragments
of the later Comedy we begin to find passages bearing on agriculture,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and it is surely a mere accident that we do not have them in those of
the earlier.</p>

<p>The contrast between life in town and life in the country is forcibly
brought out<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> by Menander. The poor man has no chance in town,
where he is despised and wronged: in the country he is spared the
galling presence of witnesses, and can bear his ill fortune on a lonely
farm. The farm then is represented as a sort of refuge from unsatisfactory
surroundings in the city. When we remember that in Menander’s
time Athens was a dependency of one or other of Alexander’s
Successors, a community of servile rich and mean poor, fawning on its
patrons and enjoying no real freedom of state-action, we need not
wonder at the poet’s putting such a view into the mouths of some of
his characters. The remains of the play Γεωργὸς are of particular
interest. The old master is a tough obstinate old fellow, who persists
in working<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> on the land himself, and even wounds himself by clumsy
use of his mattock. But he has a staff of slaves, barbarians, on whom
he is dependent. These paid no attention to the old man in his misfortune;
a touch from which we may infer that the relations between
master and slaves were not sympathetic. But a young free labourer
in his employ comes to the rescue, nurses him, and sets him on his
legs again. While laid up, the old man learns by inquiry that this
youth is his own son, the fruit of a former amour, whom his mother
has reared in struggling poverty. Enough of the play remains to
shew that the trials of the free poor were placed in a strong light,
and that, as pointed out above, the struggle for existence in the city
was felt to be especially severe. In this case whether the old man is
rich or not does not appear: at all events he has enough property to
make amends for his youthful indiscretions by relieving the necessities
of those who have a claim on him. He is probably the character in
whose mouth<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> were put the words ‘I am a rustic (ἄγροικος); that I
don’t deny; and not fully expert in affairs of city life (lawsuits etc?):
but I was not born yesterday.’</p>

<p>The functions of the rustic slaves may give us some notion of the
kind of farms that Menander had in mind. In the Γεωργός, the slave
Davus, coming in from his day’s labour, grumbles<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> at the land on which
he has to work: shrubs and flowers of use only for festival decorations
grow there as vigorous weeds, but when you sow seed you get back
what you sowed with no increase. This savours of the disappointing
tillage of an upland farm. In the Ἐπιτρέποντες<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>, Davus is a shepherd,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Syriscus a charcoal-burner, occupations also proper to the hill districts.
We must not venture to infer that Attic agriculture was mainly of this
type in the poet’s day. The favourite motive of plots in the later
Comedy, the exposure of infants in remote spots, their rescue by casual
herdsmen or other slaves, and their eventual identification as the very
person wanted in each case to make all end happily, would of itself
suggest that lonely hill-farms, rather than big estates in the fat lowland,
should be the scene. From my point of view the fact of chief interest is
that slave-labour appears as normal in such an establishment. Rustic
clothing<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and food served out in rations<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
    are minor details of the
picture, and the arrangement by which a slave can work as wage-earner<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
for another employer, paying over a share to his own master
(the ἀποφορά), surely indicates that there was nothing exceptional
about it. There are one or two other fragments directly bearing on
agricultural labour. One of uncertain age<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> speaks of a tiresome hand
who annoys his employer by chattering about some public news from
the city, when he should be digging. I doubt whether a slave is meant:
at least he is surely a hired one, but why not a poor freeman, reduced
to wage-earning? Such is the position of Timon<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> in Lucian—μισθοῦ
γεωργεῖ—a passage in which adaptations from Comedy are reasonably
suspected. That rustic labour has a better side to it, that ‘the bitter of
agriculture has a touch of sweet in it,’ is admitted<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> by one of Menander’s
characters, but the passage which seems the most genuine expression
of the prevalent opinion<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> is that in which we read that a man’s true
part is to excel in war, ‘for agriculture is a bondman’s task’ (τὸ γὰρ
γεωργεῖν ἔργον ἐστὶν οἰκέτου).</p>

<p>The nature and condition of the evidence must be my excuse for
the unsatisfactory appearance of this section. The number of passages
bearing on slavery in general, and the social and moral questions connected
therewith, is large and remote from my subject. They are of
great interest as illustrating the movement of thought on these matters,
but their bearing on agricultural labour is very slight. To the virtues
of agriculture as a pursuit tending to promote a sound and manly
character Menander<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> bears witness. ‘A farm is for all men a trainer in
virtue and a freeman’s life.’ Many a town-bred man has thought and
said the same, but praise is not always followed by imitation. Even
more striking is another<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> remark, ‘farms that yield but a poor living
make brave men.’ For it was the hard-living rustics from the back-country
parts of Greece that succeeded as soldiers of fortune, the famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Greek mercenaries whose services all contemporary kings were eager
to secure. In short, to the onlooker it seemed a fine thing to be
bred a healthy rustic, but the rustic himself was apt to prefer a less
monotonous and more remunerative career.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV">XIV. EARLY LAWGIVERS AND THEORISTS.</h3>

<p>The treatises of the two great philosophers on the state (and therefore
on the position of agriculture in the state) did not spring suddenly
out of nothing; nor was it solely the questionings of Socrates<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> that
turned the attention of Plato and Aristotle to the subject. Various
lawgivers had shewn in their systems a consciousness of its importance,
and speculative thinkers outside<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> the ranks of practical statesmen had
designed model constitutions in which a reformed land-system played
a necessary part. It is to Aristotle, the great collector of experience,
that we owe nearly all our information of these attempts. It is convenient
to speak of them briefly together. All recognize much the same
difficulties, and there is a striking similarity in the means by which they
propose to overcome them. The lawgivers<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> referred to are <b>Pheidon</b>
of Corinth and <b>Philolaus</b>, also a Corinthian though his laws were
drafted for Thebes, and thirdly<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> <b>Solon</b>. The dates of the first two are
uncertain, but they belong to early times. The two constitution-framers<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
are <b>Hippodamus</b> of Miletus, whose birth is placed about 475 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, and
<b>Phaleas</b> of Chalcedon, probably somewhat later. Both witnessed the
growth of imperial Athens, and Phaleas at least is thought to have
been an elder contemporary of Plato. Very little is known about them.
If we say that the attempt to design ideal state systems shews that
they were not satisfied with those existing, and that the failure of past
legislation may have encouraged them to theorize, we have said about
all that we are entitled to infer.</p>

<p>On one point there was general agreement among Greek states: all
desired to be ‘free’ or independent of external control. For some
special purpose one people might for a time be recognized as the
Leaders (ἡγεμόνες) of a majority of states, or more permanently as
Representatives or Patrons (προστάται). But these unofficial titles only
stood for a position acquiesced in under pressure of necessity. Each
community wanted to live its own life in its own way, and the extreme
jealousy of interference remained. Side by side with this was an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
internal jealousy causing serious friction in most of the several states, at
first between nobles and commons, later between rich and poor. The
seditions (στάσεις) arising therefrom were causes, not only of inner
weakness and other evils, but in particular of intervention from without
Therefore it was often the policy of the victors in party strife to expel
or exterminate their opponents, in order to secure to themselves undisputed
control of their own state. This tendency operated to perpetuate
the smallness of scale in Greek states, already favoured by the
physical features of the land. That the Greeks with all their cleverness
never invented what we call Representative Government is no wonder.
Men’s views in general were directed to the independence of their own
state under control of their own partisans. The smaller the state, the
easier it was to organize the control: independence could only be maintained
by military efficiency, and unanimous loyalty was something to
set off against smallness of numbers. Moreover the Greek mind had an
artistic bent, and the sense of proportion was more easily and visibly
gratified on a smaller scale. The bulk of Persia did not appear favourable
to human freedom and dignity as understood in Hellas. In the
Persian empire there was nothing that a Greek would recognize as
citizenship. The citizen of a Greek state expected to have some voice
in his own government: the gulf between citizen and non-citizen was
the line of division, but even in Sparta the full citizens were equals in
legal status among themselves. We may fairly say that the principle of
equality (τὸ ἴσον) was at the root of Greek notions of citizenship.
Privilege did not become less odious as it ceased to rest on ancestral
nobility and became more obviously an advantage claimed by wealth.</p>

<p>Since the light thrown on the subject<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> by Dr Grundy, no one will
dispute the importance of economic considerations in Greek policy, and
in particular of the ever-pressing question of the food-supply. The
security of the land and crops was to most states a vital need, and
necessitated constant readiness to maintain it in arms. Closely connected
therewith was the question of distribution. Real property was
not only the oldest and most permanent investment. Long before
Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> declared that ‘the country is a public thing’ (κοινόν), that is
an interest of the community, that opinion was commonly held, whether
formulated or instinctive. The position of the landless man was traditionally
a dubious one. The general rule was that only a citizen could
own land in the territory of the state. From this it was no great step
to argue that every citizen ought to own a plot of land within the
borders. This was doubtless not always possible. In such a state as
Corinth or Megara or Miletus commercial growth in a narrow territory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
had led to extensive colonization from those centres. And the normal
procedure in the foundation of Greek colonies was to divide the occupied
territory into lots (κλῆροι) and assign them severally to settlers.
In course of time the discontents generated by land-monopolizing in
old Hellas were liable to reappear beyond the seas, particularly in
colonial states of rapid growth: a notorious instance is found in the
troubles arising at Syracuse out of the squatter-sovranty created by
the original colonists. We meet with plans for confiscation and redistribution
of land as a common phenomenon of Greek revolutions. The
mischievous moral effects of so unsettling a process on political wellbeing
did not escape the notice of thoughtful observers. But on one
important point we have practically no evidence. Did the new allottees
wish to be, and in fact normally become, working farmers (αὐτουργοί)?
Or did they aim at providing for themselves an easy life, supported by
the labour of slaves? I wish I could surely and rightly decide between
these alternatives. As it is, I can only say that I believe the second to
be nearer the truth.</p>

<p>Under such conditions Greek lawgivers and theorists alike seem to
have looked to much the same measures for remedying evils that they
could not ignore. The citizen as landholder is the human figure with
which they are all concerned. To prevent destitution arising from the
loss<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> of his land-lot is a prime object. Some therefore would forbid the
sale of the lot. To keep land in the same hands it was necessary to
regulate numbers of citizen households, and this was attempted<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> in the
laws of Pheidon. Families may die out, so rules to provide for perpetuity
by adoptions<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> were devised by Philolaus. Again, there is the
question of the size of the lots, and this raises the further question of
a limit to acquisition. Such a limitation is attributed<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> to certain early
lawgivers not named, and with them apparently to Solon. Phaleas
would insist on equality of landed estate<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> among his citizens: a proposal
which Aristotle treats as unpractical, referring to only one form of
wealth, and leaving out of account slaves, tame animals, coin, and the
dead-stock tools etc. His exclusive attention to internal civic wellbeing
is also blamed, for it is absurd to disregard the relations of a state to
other states: there must be a foreign policy, therefore you must provide<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
military force. The fanciful scheme of Hippodamus, a strange
doctrinaire genius, seems to have been in many points inconsistent
from want of attention to practical detail. From Aristotle’s account he
appears not to have troubled himself with the question of equal land-lots,
but his fixing the number<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> of citizens (10,000) is evidence that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
point of view necessitated a limit. He proceeds on a system of triads.
The citizens are grouped in three classes, artisans (τεχνῖται), husbandmen
(γεωργοί), and the military, possessors of arms. The land is either
sacred (for service of religion, ἱερά), public (δημοσία or κοινή) or the
property of the husbandmen (ἰδία). The three classes of land and
citizens are to be assumed equal. The military are to be supported by
the produce of the public land. But who cultivates it? Aristotle shews
that the scheme is not fully thought out. If the soldiers, then the distinction,
obviously intended, between soldier and farmer, is lost. If the
farmers, then the distinction between the public and private land is
meaningless. If neither, a fourth class, not allowed for in the plan, will
be required. This last is probably what Hippodamus meant: but to
particularize the employment of slaves may have appeared superfluous.
Into the purely constitutional details I need not enter, but one criticism
is so frankly expressive of Greek ideas that it can hardly be omitted.
What, says Aristotle, is the use of political rights to the artisans and
husbandmen? they are unarmed, and therefore will practically be slaves
of the military class. This was the truth in Greek politics generally,
and is one of the most significant facts to be borne in mind when
considering the political failure of the Greeks.</p>

<p>A curious difference of economic view is shewn in the position
assigned to the artisan<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> or craftsman element by Hippodamus and
Phaleas respectively. Phaleas would have them state-slaves (δημόσιοι),
Hippodamus makes them citizens, though unarmed. On the former
plan the state would no doubt feed them and use their produce, as we
do with machinery. Of the latter plan Aristotle remarks that τεχνῖται
are indispensable: all states need them, and they can live of the earnings
of their crafts, but the γεωργοὶ as a distinct class are superfluous.
We may reply that, if the craftsmen live of their earnings and stick to
their several crafts, they will need to buy food, and the farmers are
surely there to supply it. The reply is so obvious that one feels as if
Aristotle’s meaning had been obscured through some mishap to the
text. For the present purpose it suffices that the professional craftsmen
in these two Utopias are to be either actual slaves or citizens <i>de iure</i>
who are <i>de facto</i> as helpless as slaves. In the scheme of Hippodamus
the farmer-class also are virtually the slaves of the military. Another
notable point, apparently neglected by Hippodamus, is the trust reposed
in education<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> or training by both Phaleas and his critic. How to implant
in your citizens the qualities needed for making your institutions
work well in practice, is the problem. Phaleas would give all the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
training, on the same principle as he gives equal land-lots. To Aristotle
this seems crude nonsense: the problem to him is the discovery of the
appropriate training, whether the same for all or not. This insistence
on training as the main thing in citizen-making is, as we shall see,
a common feature of Greek political speculation. But in the artistic
desire to produce the ‘complete citizen,’ and thereby make possible a
model state, the specializing mania outruns the humbler considerations
of everyday human society, and agriculture, for all its confessed importance,
is apt to be treated with something very like contempt. The
tendency to regard farmer and warrior as distinct classes is unmistakeable.
The peasant-soldier of Roman tradition is not an ordinary Greek
figure. How far the small scale of Greek states may have favoured this
differentiation is very hard to say. But Greek admiration for the
athlete type had probably something to do with the growth of military
professionalism.</p>

<p>The recognition of a land-question and attempts to find a solution
were probably stimulated by observation of contemporary phenomena,
especially in the two leading states of the fifth century. Sparta had
long held the first place, and even the rise of Athens had not utterly
destroyed her ancient prestige. That her military system was effective,
seemed proved by the inviolability of Laconian territory and the successes
of her armies in external wars. That it was supported by the
labour of a Greek population reduced to serfdom, was perhaps a weak
point in her institutions; but that Greek opinion was seriously shocked
by the fact can hardly be maintained. It was now and then convenient
to use it as a passing reproach, but even Athens did not refuse to aid
in putting down Helot rebellions. And this weak point was set off by
a strong one. Whatever the reasons<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> for her policy, she interfered very
little in the internal affairs of her allies and did not tax them. To be
content with the leadership of confederates, and not to convert it into
an empire of subjects, assured to her a certain amount of respectful
sympathy in the jealous Greek world. Thus she afforded an object-lesson
in the advantages of rigid specialization. She provided her own
food in time of peace, and took her opponents’ food in time of war.
The disadvantages of her system were yet to appear. Athens on the
other hand was becoming more and more dependent on imported food.
She was the leader of the maritime states and islands: she had become
their imperial mistress. However easy her yoke might be in practice,
it left no room for independent action on the part of her subject allies:
what had been contributions from members of a league had become
virtually imperial taxation, and to Greek prejudices such taxation
appeared tyranny. Nor was this prejudice allowed to die out. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
rival interests of commercial Corinth saw to it that the enslavement,
not of Greeks but of Greek states, should be continually borne in mind.
The contrast between the two leading powers was striking. But, if
many Greek states feared in Athens a menace to their several independence,
on the other hand they shrank from copying the rigid discipline
of Sparta. No wonder that some of the more imaginative minds had
dreams of a system more congenial to Greek aspirations. But the land-question
was a stumbling-block. That a citizen should take an active
personal share in politics was assumed, and that he should do this
tended to make him depute non-political duties to others. Thus the
notion that all citizens should be equal in the eye of the law and share
in government—democracy in short—was not favourable to personal
labour on the land. No distribution of land-lots could convert the city
politician into a real working farmer. Therefore either there must be
a decline in agriculture or an increase of slave-labour, or both. From
these alternatives there was no escape: but ingenious schemers long
strove to find a way. And from those days to these no one has succeeded
in constructing a sound and lasting civilization on a basis of
slavery.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XV">XV. PLATO.</h3>

<p>An Athenian who died in 347 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> at the age of 80 or 82 years had
witnessed extraordinary changes in the Hellenic world, more particularly
in the position of Athens. With the political changes we are
not here directly concerned. But they were closely connected with
economic changes, both as cause and as effect. The loss of empire<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
entailed loss of revenue. The amounts available as state-pay being
reduced, the poorer citizens lost a steady source of income: that their
imperial pride had departed did not tend to make them less sensitive
to the pinch of poverty. Athens, thrown back upon her own limited
resources, had to produce what she could in order to buy what she
needed, and capital, employing slave-labour, found its opportunity.
In this atmosphere discontent and jealousy grew fast: conflicting interests
of rich and poor were at the back of all the disputes of political
life. Athens it is true avoided the crude revolutionary methods adopted
in some less civilized states. The Demos did not massacre or banish
the wealthy Few, and share out their lands and other properties among
the poor Many. But they consistently regarded the estates of the rich
as the source from which the public outlay should as far as possible be
drawn. They left the capitalist free to make money in his own way,
and squeezed him when he had made it. Whether he were citizen or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
metic<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> mattered not from the economic point of view. Capitalistic
industry was really slave-industry. The ‘small man’ had the choice of
either competing, perhaps vainly, with the ‘big man’ on the land or in
the workshop, or of giving up the struggle and using his political power
to make the ‘big man’ disgorge some of his profits. Moreover military
life no longer offered the prospects of conquest and gain that had made
it attractive. The tendency was to treat the citizen army as a defensive
force, and to employ professional mercenaries (of whom there was now<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
no lack) on foreign service. To a thoughtful observer these phenomena
suggested uneasy reflexions. Demos in Assembly was a dispiriting
spectacle. Selfish<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and shortsighted, he cared more for his own belly
and his amusements than for permanent interests of state. Perhaps
this was no new story. But times had changed, and the wealthy imperial
Athens, able to support the burden of her own defects, had passed
away. Bad government in reduced circumstances might well be productive
of fatal results.</p>

<p>It was not Athens alone that had failed. Fifteen years before
Plato’s death the failure of both Sparta and Thebes had left Hellas
exhausted<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and without a leading state to give some sort of unity to
Greek policy. There was still a common Hellenic feeling, but it was
weak compared with separatist jealousy. Antipathy to the Barbarian
remained: but the Persian power had been called in by Greeks to aid
them against other Greeks, and this was a serious danger to the Greek
world. Things were even worse in the West. How anarchic democracy
had paved the way for military tyranny at Syracuse, how the tyranny
had lowered the standard of Greek civilization in Sicily and Italy, and
had been the ruin of Greek cities, no man of that age knew better than
Plato. Plato was not singular in his distrust of democracy: that attitude
was common enough. Among the companions of Socrates I need only
refer to Xenophon and Critias. Socrates had insisted that government
is a difficult art, for success in which a thorough training is required.
Now, whatever might be the case in respect of tyrannies or oligarchies,
democracy was manifestly an assertion of the principle that all citizens
were alike qualified for a share in the work of government. Yet no
craftsman would dream of submitting the work of his own trade to the
direction of amateurs. Why then should the amateur element, led by
amateurs, dominate in the sphere of politics? It was easy to find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
instances of the evil effects of amateurism in public affairs. It is true
that this line of argument contained a fallacy, as arguments from
analogy very often do. But it had a profound influence on Plato, and
it underlay all his political speculations. It was reinforced by an influence
that affected many of his contemporaries, admiration of Sparta
on the score of the permanence<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> of her system of government. That
this admiration was misguided, and the permanence more apparent
than real, matters not: to a Greek thinker it was necessarily attractive,
seeking for some possibly permanent principle of government, and
disgusted with the everlasting flux of Hellenic politics. Nor was there
anything strange in imagining an ideal state in which sound principles
might be carried into effect. The foundation of colonies, in which the
settlers made a fresh start as new communities, was traditionally a
Greek custom. Such was the foundation, logical and apparently consistent
with experience, on which Plato designed to build an Utopia.
Avoiding the unscientific <i>laisser-faire</i> of democratic politics, functions
were to be divided on a rational system, and government placed in the
hands of trained specialists.</p>

<p>It is well to note some of the defects of Greek civilization as Plato
saw it, particularly in Athens. The confusion and weakness of democratic
government, largely the fruit of ignorance haste and prejudice,
has been referred to above. In most states the free citizen population
were born and bred at the will of their fathers under no scientific state-regulation,
not sifted out in youth by scientific selection, and only
trained up to the average standard locally approved. Something better
was needed, if more was to be got out of human capacity. But it seems
certain that Plato found the chief and most deep-seated source of social
and political evils in the economic situation. The unequal distribution
of wealth and the ceaseless struggle between rich and poor lay at the
root of that lack of harmonious unity in which he saw the cause of the
weakness and unhappiness of states. To get rid of the plutocrat and
the beggar<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> was a prime object. Confiscation and redistribution<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
    offered
no lasting remedy, so long as men remained what they were. A complete
moral change was necessary, and this could only be effected by
an education that should train all citizens cheerfully and automatically
to bear their several parts in promoting the happiness of all. There
must be no more party-strivings after the advantage of this or that
section: the guiding principle must be diversity of individual functions
combined with unity of aim. An ideal state must be the Happy Land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of the Expert, and each specialist must mind his own business. Thus
each will enjoy his own proper happiness: friction competition and
jealousy will pass away. There will be no more hindrance to the
efficiency of craftsmen: we shall not see one tempted by wealth<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> to
neglect his trade, while another is too poor to buy the appliances
needed for turning out good work. The expert governors or Guardians
must be supplied with all necessaries<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> by the classes engaged in the
various forms of production. Thus only can they be removed from
the corruptions that now pervert politicians. To them at least all
private property must be denied. And, in order that they may be as
expert in their own function of government as other craftsmen are in
their several trades, they must be bred selected and educated on a
strictly scientific system the very opposite of the haphazard methods
now in vogue.</p>

<p>This brief sketch of the critical and constructive scope of the <i>Republic</i>
must suffice for my purpose. Plato laid his finger on grave
defects, but his remedies seem fantastic in the light of our longer and
more varied experience. Any reform of society had to be carried out
by human agency, and for the difficulty of adapting this no adequate
allowance is made. He recognizes the difficulty of starting an ideal
community on his model. Old prejudices will be hard to overcome.
So he suggests<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> that it will be necessary for the philosophical rulers to
clear the ground by sending all the adult inhabitants out into the
country, keeping in the city only the children of ten years and under:
these they will train up on their system. He implies that with the
younger generation growing up under properly regulated conditions
the problems of establishment will solve themselves by the effect of
time. This grotesque proposal may indicate that Plato did not mean
his constructive design to be taken very seriously. But a more notable
weakness appears in the narrowness of outlook. It was natural that a
Greek should think and write as a Greek for Greeks, and seek lessons
in Greek experience. But the blight of disunion and failure was already
on the little Greek states; and their experience, not likely to recur,
has in fact never really recurred. Hence the practical value of Plato’s
stimulating criticism and construction is small. In the labour-question
we find no advance. Slavery is assumed as usual, but against the enslavement
of Greeks, of which recent warfare supplied many examples,
he makes<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> a vigorous protest. Euripides had gone further than this,
and questionings of slavery had not been lacking. Another very Greek
limitation of view comes out in the contempt<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> for βαναυσία, the assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
physical and moral inferiority of persons occupied in sedentary trades.
That such men were unfitted for the rough work of war, and therefore
unfitted to take part in ruling an independent Greek state, was an
opinion not peculiar to Plato. But this objection could not well be
raised against the working farmer. Why then does Plato exclude the
farmer-class from a share in the government of his ideal state? I think
we may detect three reasons. First, the husbandman, though necessary
to the state’s existence, has not the special training required for government,
nor the leisure to acquire it. Second, it is his intense occupation
that alone secures to the ruling class the leisure needful for their responsible
duties. Third, the belief<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> that a man cannot be at the same
time a good husbandman and a good soldier. These three may be
regarded as one: the philosopher would get rid of haphazard amateurism
by making the expert specialist dominant in all departments of civil
and military life. The influence of the Spartan system (much idealized),
and the growth of professional soldiering, on his theories is too obvious
to need further comment.</p>

<p>Reading the <i>Republic</i> from the labour-question point of view, one
is struck by the lack of detail as to the condition of the classes whose
labour feeds and clothes the whole community. We must remember
that the dialogue starts with an attempt to define Justice, in the course
of which a wider field of inquiry is opened up by assuming an analogy<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
between the individual and the state. As the dominance of his nobler
element over his baser elements is the one sure means of ensuring the
individual’s lasting happiness, so the dominance of the nobler element
in the state alone offers a like guarantee. On these lines the argument
proceeds, using an arbitrary psychology, and a fanciful political criticism
to correspond. The construction of a model state is rather incidental
than essential to the discussion. No wonder that, while we have much
detail as to the bodily and mental equipment of the ‘Guardians’ (both
the governing elders and the warrior youths) we get no information as
to the training of husbandmen and craftsmen. Like slaves, they are
assumed to exist: how they become and remain what they are assumed
to be, we are not told. We are driven to guess that at this stage of
his speculations Plato was content to take over these classes just as
he found them in the civilization of his day. But he can hardly have
imagined that they would acquiesce in any system by which they would
be excluded from all political power. The hopeless inferiority of the
husbandman is most clearly marked when contrasted with the young
warriors of the ‘Guardian’ class. Duties are so highly specialized that
men are differentiated for life. The γεωργὸς cannot be a good soldier.
But if a soldier shews cowardice he is to be punished<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> by being made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
a γεωργὸς or δημιουργός—a degradation in itself, and accompanied by
no suggestion of a special training being required to fit him for his
new function. It is unnecessary to enlarge on such points: constructors
of Utopias cannot avoid some inconsistencies and omissions. The
simple fact is that the arrangements for differentiation of classes in the
model state are not fully worked out in detail.</p>

<p>Plato’s Guardians are to have no private property; for it is private
property<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> that seems to him the cause of sectional and personal interests
which divide and weaken the state and lead to unhappiness.
But the other classes are not so restricted. They can own land and
houses etc; on exactly what tenure, is less clear. Meanwhile, what is
it that the Guardians have in common? It is the sustenance (τροφὴ)
provided as pay (μισθὸς) for their services by the mass of workers
over whom they rule. It is expressly stated<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> that in the model state
the Demos will call the Rulers their Preservers and Protectors, and
the Rulers call the Demos their Paymasters and Sustainers. In existing
states other than democracies their mutual relation is too often
expressed as that of Masters and Slaves. I cannot refrain from noting
that, if the pay of the Guardians consists in their sustenance, this is
so far exactly the case of slaves. That power and honour should be
reserved for men maintained thus, without private emoluments, is remarkable.
The Spartiates, however much an idealizing of their system
may have suggested the arrangement, were maintained by the sulky
labour of Helot serfs. Are the husbandmen in Plato’s scheme really
any better than Helots? In describing the origin of states in general,
Plato finds the cause<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> of that development in the insufficiency of individuals
to meet their own needs. But in tracing the process of the
division of labour, and increasing complexity of civilization, he ignores
slavery, though slavery is often referred to in various parts of the book.
Now, if the husbandman has under him no slaves, and is charged with
the food-supply of his rulers, he comes very near to the economic
status of a serf. He works with his own hands, but not entirely at
his own will or for his own profit. And in one respect he would, to
Greek critics, seem inferior to a Spartan<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Helot: he is, by the extreme
specializing system, denied all share in military service, and so can
hardly be reckoned a citizen at all. How came Plato to imagine for a
single moment that a free Greek would acquiesce in such a position?
I can only guess that the present position of working farmers and
craftsmen in trades seemed to him an intolerable one. If, as I believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
from the indications in Xenophon and other authorities, agriculture
and the various industries of Attica were now steadily passing into the
hands of slaveowning capitalists, and small men going to the wall,
there would be much to set a philosopher thinking and seeking some
way of establishing a wholesomer state of things. On this supposition
speculations, however fantastic and incapable of realization in fact,
might call attention to practical evils and at least prepare men’s minds
for practical remedies. In admitting the difficulty of making a fresh
start, and the certainty that even his model state would in time lose
its purity<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and pass through successive phases of decay, Plato surely
warns us not to take his constructive scheme seriously. But whether
he really believed that free handworkers could (save in an oligarchy,
which<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> he detests,) be induced to submit to a ruling class, and be
themselves excluded on principle from political interests of any kind,
is more than I can divine.</p>

<p>That the scheme outlined in the <i>Republic</i> was not a practical one
was confessed by Plato in his old age by producing the <i>Laws</i>, a work
in which the actual circumstances of Greek life were not so completely
disregarded. The main points that concern us are these. Government
is to be vested in a detailed code of laws, administered by magistrates
elected by the citizens. There is a Council and an Assembly. Pressure
is put upon voters, especially<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> on the wealthier voters, to make them
vote. The influence of the Solonian model is obvious. Provision is
made<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> for getting over the difficulties of the first start, while the people
are still under old traditions which the new educational system will in
due course supersede. But, so far from depending on perfect Guardians
with absolute power, and treating law as a general pattern<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> modifiable
in application by the Guardians at their discretion, we have law
supreme and Guardians dependent on the people’s will. It is a kind
of democracy, but Demos is to be carefully trained, and protected from
his own vagaries by minute regulations. The number of citizens<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> is by
law fixed at 5040. Each one has an allotment of land, a sacred κλῆρος
that cannot be sold. This passes by inheritance from father to son as
an undivided whole. Extinction of a family may be prevented by
adoptions under strict rules. Excess of citizen population may be relieved
by colonies. Poverty is excluded<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> by the minimum guaranteed
in the inalienable land-lot, excessive wealth by laws fixing a maximum.
It is evident that in this detailed scheme of the <i>Laws</i> agriculture must
have its position more clearly defined than in the <i>Republic</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>So indeed it has. In order that all may have a fair share, each
citizen’s land-lot<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> is in two parts, one near the city, the other near the
frontier. Thus we see that all citizens will be interested in cultivating
the land. We see also that this will be absolutely necessary: for it is
intended<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> that the model state shall not be dependent on imported food
(like Athens), but produce its own supply. Indeed commerce is to be
severely restricted. What the country cannot produce must if necessary
be bought, and for this purpose only<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> will a recognized Greek currency
be employed: internal transactions will be conducted with a local
coinage. The evil effects<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> seen to result from excessive commercial
dealings will thus be avoided. When we turn to the agricultural
labour-question, we find that wholesale employment of slaves<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> or serfs
is the foundation of the system. For Plato, holding fast to the principle
of specialization, holds also that leisure<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> is necessary for the
citizens if they are to bear their part in politics with intelligent judgment.
As, in this second-best Utopia, the citizens are the landowners,
and cannot divest themselves of their civic responsibilities, they must
do their cultivating by deputy. And this practically amounts to building
the fabric of civilization on a basis of slavery—nothing less. In the
matter of agriculture, the industry on which this self-sufficing community
really rests, this dependence on slave-labour is most striking.
It even includes a system<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> of serf-tenants (probably for the borderland
farms) who are to be left to cultivate the land, paying a rent or quota
of produce (ἀπαρχὴ) to the owners. The importance of not having too
large a proportion<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> of the slaves in a gang drawn from any one race is
insisted on as a means of preventing combinations and risings. At the
same time careful management is enjoined, sympathetic<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> but firm: a
master should be kind, but never forget that he is a master: no slave
must be allowed to take liberties. To implant a sound tradition of
morality is recognized as a means of promoting good order in the
community, and this influence should be brought to bear<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> on slaves as
well as on freemen. Yet the intrinsic chattelhood of the slave appears
clearly in many ways; for instance, the damage to a slave is made
good by compensating<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> his owner. The carelessness of ill-qualified
practitioners<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> who treat slaves, contrasted with the zeal of competent
doctors in treating freemen, is another significant touch.</p>

<p>It seems then that Plato, the more he adapts his speculations to
the facts of existing civilization, the more positively he accepts slave-labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
as a necessary basis. The conception of government as an art
is surely the chief cause of this attitude. The extreme specialization of
the <i>Republic</i> is moderated in the <i>Laws</i>, but there is not much less
demand for leisure, if the civic artists are to be unhampered in the
practice of their art. Of the dangers<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> of servile labour on a large scale
he was well aware, and he had evidently studied with attention<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> the
awkward features of serfdom, not only in the old Hellas, but in the
Greek colonial states of the East and West. Nevertheless he would
found his economy on the forced labour of human chattels. A system
that had grown up in the course of events, extending or contracting
according to changes of economic circumstance, was thus presented as
the deliberate result of independent thought. But the only theory at
the back of traditional slavery was the law<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> of superior force—originally
the conqueror’s will. Plato was therefore driven to accept this law as
a principle of human society. To accept it was to bring his speculations
more into touch with Greek notions; for no people have surpassed
the Greeks in readiness to devolve upon others the necessary but
monotonous drudgery of life. This attitude of his involves the conclusion
that the Barbarian is to serve the Greek, a position hardly consistent
with his earlier<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> doctrine, that no true line could be drawn
distinguishing Greek and Barbarian. Such a flux of speculative opinion
surely weakens our respect for Plato’s judgment in these matters. We
can hardly say that he offers any effective solution of the great state-problems
of his age. But that these problems were serious and disquieting
his repeated efforts bear witness. And one of the most serious
was certainly that of placing the agricultural interest on a sound
footing. Its importance he saw: but neither of his schemes, neither
passive free farmers nor slave-holding landlords, was likely to produce
the desired result. To say this is not to blame a great man’s failure.
Centuries have passed, and experience has been gained, without a
complete solution being reached: the end is not yet.</p>

<p>A few details remain to be touched on separately. The employment
of hired labourers is referred to as normal<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> in the <i>Politicus</i>
<i>Republic</i> and <i>Laws</i>. They are regarded simply as so much physical
strength at disposal. They are free, and so able to transfer their labour
from job to job according to demand. Intellectually and politically
they do not count. But the μισθωτὸς is neither a chattel like the slave,
nor bound to the soil like the serf. I have found no suggestion of the
employment of this class in agriculture; and, as I have said above, I
believe that they were in fact almost confined to the towns, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
such as the Peiraeus. It is also worth noticing that we find favourable
mention of apprenticeship<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> as a method of learning a trade. But this
principle also seems not applied to agriculture. Again, we are told<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> in
the <i>Laws</i> that one who has never served (δουλεύσας) will never turn
out a creditable master (δεσπότης). From the context this would seem
to refer only to the wardens of the country (ἀγρονόμοι), who must be
kept under strict discipline in order to perform very responsible duties.
It does not apply to farmers. Another curious rule<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> is that kidnapping
of men is not to be allowed. Yet there are bought slaves, and therefore
a market. That the dealer in human flesh should be despised<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> by
his customers is a feeling probably older than Plato, and it lasted down
to the days of <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>. In view of Plato’s acceptance of the
sharp line drawn between Greek and Barbarian (and this does touch
rustic slavery) it is interesting to note that he observed<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> with care the
different characters of alien peoples. He also refers<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> to them without
contempt in various contexts side by side with Greeks, and cites<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> their
common belief as a proof of the existence of the gods.</p>

<p>If I may venture to make a general comment on Plato’s position
in relation to the labour-question, I would remark that he is already in
the same difficulty which proved embarrassing to Aristotle, and which
has always beset those who seek to find a theoretical justification for
slavery. True, he is less definite and positive than Aristotle, but the
attempt to regard a human being as both a man and a chattel is a
failure. This point need not be further pressed here. But it is well to
observe that agriculture is the department in which the absurdity most
strikingly appears. Heavy farm-labour without prospect of personal
advantage was recognized as a function that no man would willingly
perform. Hence to be sent to labour on a farm was one of the punishments
that awaited the offending domestic slave. Hence overseers
were employed to exact from rustic slaves their daily task under the
menace of severe and often cruel punishments. Hence the humaner
masters (as Xenophon shews us) tried to secure more cheerful and
effective service by a system of little rewards for good work. In short
there was in practical life a miserable attempt to treat the slave both
as a brute beast and as a moral being capable of weighing consequences
and acting accordingly. One form of reward, manumission, was
apparently not at this time common<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> in Greece: and it was one not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
easy to apply in agriculture. It was not easy to know what to do with
a worn-out farm-hand, unless he was transferred to lighter duties on
the farm; for he would be useless elsewhere. Sooner or later a time
would come when he could no longer do anything of any value. What
then? Was he charitably fed by the master<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> whom he had served, or
was he cast adrift in nominal freedom? From the fragments of Comedy
one may perhaps guess that the humaner practice generally prevailed.
But the silence of Plato seems to suggest that to him, and indeed to
Greeks generally, the point was not an important one. Even for a
citizen, if destitute in old age, the state-relief was very small. We must
therefore not wonder at the silence generally maintained as to the
treatment of the worn-out rustic slave. Slave artisans, and those whose
services were let out to other employers with reservation of a rent to
their own masters, could scrape together the means of sustenance in
their old age. It is possible that manumission of rustic slaves may
have occasionally taken place, and that they too may have scraped together
some small savings: but I can find no ground for thinking that
such cases were normal or even frequent. In the <i>Laws</i> Plato allows
for the presence of freedmen<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>, and frames regulations for their control,
probably suggested by experience of the Attic laws and their defects.
Manumission by the state<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> as reward of slave-informers is also mentioned.
But there is nothing in these passages to weaken the natural
inference that town slaves, and chiefly domestics, are the class to
whom in practice such rules would apply. In short, we must not look
to a philosopher reared in a civilization under which manual labour
tended to become the burden of the unfree and the destitute, and to
be despised as mean and unworthy of the free citizen, for a wholesome
solution of the problem of farm-labour.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVI">XVI. THE EARLIER ATTIC ORATORS.</h3>

<p>It is convenient to take the speeches and pamphlets of the masters
of Attic oratory in two sections, though there can be no exact chronological
division between the two. The political background is different
in the two cases. To Isocrates the urgent problem is how to compose
Greek jealousies by uniting in an attack on the common enemy,
Persia: to Demosthenes it is how to save the separate independence
of the weary Greek states from the control of the encroaching king of
Macedon. True, the disunion of Greece was not to be ended by either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
effort. But the difficulties of Isocrates lay largely outside Athens: the
states did not want to have a leader; Philip, to whom he turned in his
old age, was no more welcome to them than the rest of his proposed
leaders. Demosthenes had to face the fact of a Macedonian party in
Athens itself, as well as to overcome the apathy and inertia which had
been growing continually since the fall of the Athenian empire. His
opponents were not all mere corrupt partisans of the Macedonian king.
Athens was now no longer a great power, and they knew it: Demosthenes
is forgiven by historians for his splendid defiance of facts.
Naturally enough, in the conflicts of political opinion from the time of
the revolution of the Four Hundred to the death of Demosthenes
(411-322 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) we have few references to agriculture. Yet we know that
the question of food-supply was still a pressing one for many Greek
states, above all for Athens. Some of the references have a value as
being contemporary. But a large part of these are references to litigation,
and deal not with conditions of cultivation but with claims to
property. Among the most significant facts are the importance attached
to the control of the Hellespontine trade-route and the careful regulations
affecting the import and distribution<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> of corn.</p>

<p>The period on which we get some little light from passages in the
earlier orators is roughly about 410-350 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. It includes the general
abandonment of agricultural enterprises abroad, owing to the loss of
empire and therewith of cleruchic properties. By this shrinkage the
relative importance of home agriculture must surely have been increased.
Yet I cannot find a single direct statement or reference to this effect.
It seems reasonable to suppose that it was not necessary to assert
what was only too obvious. Corn had to be imported, and imported
it was from various<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> sources of supply. To guard against failure of
this supply was a chief preoccupation of the Athenian government.
But that some corn was still grown in Attica is clear. Isocrates says<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
that one act of hostility to the Thirty was the destruction of corn in
the country by the democrats. And in another place<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> he lays stress
upon the mythical legend of the earliest introduction of corn-growing,
the civilizing gift of Demeter to her favoured Attica. Yet there are
signs that the culture of the olive and vine was more and more displacing
cereal crops: the fig tree, often a sacred thing, was, and had
long been, a regular feature of the countryside. Live stock, goats sheep
and cattle, were probably abundant, though there was seldom need
for an orator to mention them. If we judge by the remaining references,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
it would seem that land was not generally cultivated by its owners.
Letting to tenant farmers<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> was the plan adopted by the state in dealing
with public lands, and the collection of the rents was farmed out
in its turn to capitalist speculators by public auction. We have several
specimens<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> of mixed estates, described by an orator in connexion with
some litigation. From these we may fairly infer that the policy of not
putting all their eggs into one basket found favour with Athenian
capitalists. Landed estate is in such cases but one item, side by side
with house-property, mortgages and money at interest on other
securities, slaves and other stock employed or leased to employers,
stock in hand, specie and other valuables, mentioned in more or less
detail. Consistently with this picture of landlord and tenant is the
statement<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> that formerly, in the good old times before Athens entered
upon her ill-starred career of imperialism, the country houses and establishments
of citizens were superior to those within the city walls;
so much so, that even the attraction of festivals could not draw them
to town from their comfortable country-seats. Evidently a great change
had come over rural Attica, if the writer is to be trusted. We are not
to suppose that personal direction of a farm by the owner of the land
was altogether a thing of the past. Suburban farms at least were, as
we learn from Xenophon, sometimes managed by men living in the
city and riding out to superintend operations and give orders. The
injured husband<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> defended by <b>Lysias</b> may even have gone to and fro
on foot. He does not seem to have been a wealthy man, and he may
have been a αὐτουργός, taking part in the labours of his farm: that he
earned his night’s rest and slept sound seems suggested by the context
of his curious story.</p>

<p>That there was no lack of interest in the prospects of agriculture
generally may be inferred from various references to the different
qualities of soils not only in Attica but in other parts of Greece and
abroad. The smallness of the cultivable area in rocky Samothrace<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> was
noted by <b>Antiphon</b>. <b>Isocrates</b> remarked<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> that in Laconia the Dorian
conquerors appropriated not only the greater part of the land but the
most fertile. The results of their greed and oppression had not been
wholly satisfactory in the long run: adversity carried with it the peril<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
of Helot risings. No fertility of soil can compensate for the ill effects
of bad policy and lack of moderation: the independence and wellbeing
of cramped rocky Megara, contrasted<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> with the embarrassments of wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
fruitful Thessaly, is an object-lesson. The Greek race needs to expand<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>,
as it did of old, when Athens led the colonization of the Asiatic seaboard.
It is monstrous to try and wring contributions from (δασμολογεῖν)<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
the islanders, who have to till mountain sides for lack of room.
It is in Asia that the new Greece must find relief, at the expense of
Persia, whose subjects let vast areas lie idle, while the parts that they
do cultivate keep them in great plenty; so fertile is the land. Attica
itself was once a prosperous farming country. In the good old days,
before the unhappy dissension between selfish rich and grudging poor,
agriculture was one of the chief means<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> used to avert poverty and
distress. Farms let at fair rents kept the people profitably employed,
and so out of mischief. Men could and did<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> live well in the country:
they were not jostling each other in the city to earn a bare subsistence
by pitiful state-fees—beggars all—as they are doing now. The great
pamphleteer may be overdrawing his picture, but that it contains much
truth is certain, and it seems pretty clear that he saw no prospect of a
local revival. Athens had run her course of ambitious imperialism, and
the old country life, developed in long security, could not be restored.
Any man who felt inclined to live a farmer’s life would, if I read the
situation aright, prefer some cheap and profitable venture abroad to
the heavy and unremunerative struggles of a crofter in upland Attica.
Small farms in the rich lowland were I take it very seldom to be had.
And, if he had the capital to work a large farm, he was under strong
temptation to employ his capital in urban industries, state-contracts,
loans at interest, etc, and so to distribute his risks while increasing his
returns. For his main object was to make money, not to provide
himself and his family with a healthy and comfortable home. The
land-question in Attica is illustrated by a passage of <b>Isaeus</b> in which
he refers to the fraud of a guardian. The scoundrel, he says, has robbed
his nephew of the estate: he is sticking to the farm (τὸν ἀγρόν) and has
given him a hill pasture<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> (φελλέα).</p>

<p>Farming enterprise abroad had been a product of the Athenian
empire with its cleruchies and colonies, and probably private ventures
of individuals, unofficial but practically resting on imperial protection.
The collapse of this system would ruin some settlers and speculators,
and impoverish more. Even those who returned to Athens still
possessed of considerable capital would not in all cases take to Attic
farming, even supposing that they were willing to face its risks and
that suitable farms were available. It was to Athens a most important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
object to retain or recover all she could of her island territories, partly
no doubt in order to control the cultivable lands in them. In the peace-negotiations
of 390 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> the extreme opposition party at Athens were
not content<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> with the proposals by which she was to recover the islands
of Lemnos Imbros and Scyros: they demanded also the restitution of
the Thracian Chersonese and estates and debts elsewhere. So strong
was the feeling of dependence on these investments abroad. And
<b>Isocrates</b>, in depicting the evil results of imperial ambition, recalls<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> to
the citizens that, instead of farming the lands of others, the Peloponnesian
war had for years prevented them from setting eyes upon their
own.</p>

<p>Thus far I have said nothing of the labour-question. Orators and
pamphleteers were not likely to concern themselves much with this
topic, for there was nothing in the nature of an Abolitionist controversy
to bring them into discussion of the subject. Slavery is in this department
of Greek literature more a fundamental assumption than ever.
The frequent arguments on the torture of slave witnesses and the moral
value of evidence so extracted are plain proof of this. But what about
agricultural labour? In the case of the sacred olive-stump we hear from
<b>Lysias</b><a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> that the farm in question several times changed hands by sale.
Some of the purchasers let it to tenants. The words used of the persons
who actually farmed it from time to time are the usual ones, ἐγεώργει,
εἰργάσατο etc. That these tenants were not merely αὐτουργοί, but
employers of labour, may fairly be guessed from the case of the
present tenant, accused of sacrilege. He at least is an owner of
slaves, and argues<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> that he could never have been so mad as to put
himself at their mercy. They would have witnessed his sacrilege,
and could have won their freedom by informing against their master.
Isocrates<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> draws no real distinction between serfs and slaves in the
case of Sparta. Here too the slave was dangerous, though in a
different way: but he was on the land. A fragment of <b>Isaeus</b><a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
runs ‘he left on the farm old men and cripples.’ The context is
lost, but the persons referred to must surely be slaves: no one would
employ wage-labour of this quality. In another place he casually mentions<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
the sale of a flock of goats with the goatherd. These little scraps
of evidence all serve to strengthen the impression, derived from other
sources, of slave-labour as the backbone of Attic agriculture in this
period. To free labour there are very few references, and none of these
seem to have any connexion with agriculture. This does not prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
that no hired freemen were employed on farms. For special jobs, as
we shall see later, they were called in: but this was only temporary
employment. The μισθτοὶ or θῆτες were a despised<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> class: some of
them were freedmen. The competition with slave-labour doubtless had
something to do with this, and to be driven by necessity to such labour
was galling to a citizen, as we have already learnt from Xenophon.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVII">XVII. ARISTOTLE.</h3>

<p>The great founder of the philosophy of experience is a witness<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> of
exceptional value. He collected and recorded the facts and traditions of
the past, judging them from the point of view of his own day. Stimulated
by the theories of his master Plato, he also strove, by sketching the
fabric of a model state, to indicate the lines on which Greek political
development might be conducted with advantage. Inasmuch as ideal circumstances
were rather to be desired than expected, he did not restrict
his interest in the future to the mere designing of an ideal: taking states
as he found them, conditioned by their situation and past history, he
sought for the causes of their growth and decay, and aimed at discovering
cures for their various maladies. But throughout, whether
looking to the past or the future, he was guided by a characteristic
moral purpose. For him ‘good living’ (τὸ εὖ ζῆν) is the aim and object
of political institutions. It is in the state that man finds the possibility
of reaching his full development: for he is by nature a ‘political animal.’
That is, he cannot live alone. Each step in association (household,
village,) brings him nearer to that final union of the city. In this he
attains the highest degree of manhood of which he (as Man, differentiated
from other animals by reason and speech,) is capable. This
completion of his potentialities is the proof of his true nature; that he
realizes his best self in the πόλις shews that he is a πολιτικὸν ζῷον.
The animal needs met in the more primitive associations are of course
met in the city also. But there is something more, and this something
more is a moral element, from which is derived the possibility of ‘good
living,’ as contrasted with existence of a more predominantly animal
character. Therefore, though in point of time the man comes before
the state, in logical order the state comes first: for the man can only
exist in the fulness of his nature when he is a citizen. He is by the law
of his nature part of a state, potentially: as such a part he is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
regarded. As states vary, so do the several types of citizens. In the
best state the qualities of good man and good citizen are identical and
complete.</p>

<p>The aim of political science (πολιτική) is to frame and employ the
machinery of states so as to promote the perfection of human excellence
(ἀρετή), and to train the citizens on such principles as will insure the
effective working and permanence of their institutions. We may call
it Aristotle’s response to the Greek yearning after a stability which
was in practice never attained. To design a model state was one way
of approaching the problem. But Aristotle was surely not the man to
believe that such an ideal could be practically realised. To make the best
of existing systems was a more promising enterprise. Now in either
procedure it was evident that material equipment<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> could not be left out
of account. Without food clothing and shelter men cannot live at all,
and therefore cannot live well. Experience also shewed that the means
of defence against enemies could not safely be neglected. It is under
the head of equipment (χορηγία) that we get the philosopher’s view of
the proper position of agriculture in the life of a state. We must bear
in mind the general Greek conception of citizenship common to statesmen
and theorists, present to Plato and Aristotle no less than to
Cleisthenes or Pericles. Residence gave no claim to it. Either it was
hereditary, passing from father to son on proof of citizen descent and
certain religious qualifications; or it was deliberately conferred on a
person or persons as a privilege. That beside the citizens there should
be resident within the state<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> a number of persons, not citizens or likely
to become citizens, was a necessity generally admitted. They might
be free aliens, more or less legally connected with the state, or slaves
public or private. These alien persons were very numerous in some
states, such as Athens or Corinth. Subject or serf populations of Greek
origin, as in Laconia or Thessaly, are not to be distinguished from
them for the present purpose. One common mark of citizenship was
the right of owning land within the territory of the state. We know
that the Attic landowner must be an Athenian citizen, and such was
the general rule. Who did the actual work of cultivation, or tended
the flocks and herds, is another question. We have seen reason for
believing that personal labour<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> of the owner on his farm had at one
time been usual, and that the practice still in the fourth century BC
prevailed in those parts of Greece where there had been little development
of urban life. And that slave-labour was employed by farmers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
on a greater or less scale, according to the size of their estates, seems
as certain as certain can be. In Attica the slave overseer, entrusted
with the direction of a gang of slave labourers, had become<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> a well-recognized
figure, and farming by deputy, as well as labouring by
deputy, was an ordinary thing. Citizens resided in the city more than
ever. Rich men visited their country estates to keep an eye on their
overseers, or paid the penalty of their neglect. Poor citizens, resident
and able to attend meetings of the Assembly, had to be kept quiet by
systematic provision of fees for performance of civic functions. It may
be too strong to say that squeezing the wealthy was the leading fact
of politics: but there was too much of that sort of thing, and the
scramble for state pay was demoralizing. Immediate personal interest
tended to deaden patriotism in a state that within human memory had,
whatever its faults, been the most public-spirited community among
the leading states of Greece.</p>

<p>In treating of politics, and therewith in assigning a position to
agriculture, Aristotle was affected by three main influences. First,
the historical; the experience of Greek states, and more particularly
of Athens. Secondly, the theoretical; the various attempts of earlier
philosophers, particularly of Plato, to find a solution of political problems
on speculative lines. Thirdly, his own firm conviction that the lasting
success of state life depended on devotion to a moral end. It will be
the simplest and best plan to consider his utterances on agriculture
from these three points of view.</p>

<p>The supply of food being the first of necessities, and being in fact
(as we have seen) an ever-pressing problem in Greece, it is no wonder
that land-hunger, leading to wars for territory, and land-grabbing, a
fertile cause of internal dissension and seditions in states, were normal
phenomena of Greek history. And what happened in old Hellas was
reproduced abroad, as the Greek colonists overflowed into lands beyond
the seas. Once the possession of territory was secured by war, and
the means of its defence organized, two problems soon presented themselves
for solution. It was at once necessary to decide by what labour
the land was to be cultivated. Greek colonists, desirous no doubt of
an easier life than they had led in the old country, generally contrived
to devolve this labour upon others at a very early stage of their
establishment. Either they reduced natives to the condition of serfs,
or they employed slaves, whom the profits of growing trade and commerce
enabled them to procure in larger and larger numbers. Meanwhile
in the mother country various systems went on side by side.
There were large districts of agricultural serfage, in which a race of
conquerors were supported by the labour of the conquered. In other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
parts independent peoples, backward in civilization, lived a free rustic
life of a largely pastoral character. Others again devoted themselves
more to the tillage of the soil, with or without the help of slaves. It
was known that in earlier times a population of this kind in Attica
had long existed, and that after the unification of Attica and the reforms
of Solon it had for a time been the backbone of the Athenian
state. But in fertile lowland districts there was a not unnatural tendency
towards larger estates, worked by hireling or slave-labour. It seems
fairly certain that in Attica before the time of Aristotle the supply of
free wage-earners for farm-work was failing: the development of the
city and the Peiraeus, and the growing number of those in receipt of
civil and military pay, had drawn the poor citizen away from rustic
labour. Nor is there reason to think that after the loss of empire there
was any marked movement back to the land on the part of free labourers
or even small farmers. It would rather seem that Attic land was passing
into fewer hands, and that the employment of stewards or overseers,
free or slave, was one of the features of a change by which the farming
of land was becoming a symptom of considerable wealth.</p>

<p>But beside the decision as to labour there was the question as to a
means of checking land-monopoly. Such monopoly, resulting in the
formation of a discontented urban mob, was a serious menace to the
stability of a constitution. For all poor citizens to get a living by
handicrafts was perhaps hardly possible; nor would the life of an
artisan suit the tastes and wishes of all. Nature does (or seems to do)
more for the farmer on his holding than for the artisan in his workshop,
and the claim to a share of the land within the boundaries of their
states had led to seditions and revolutions, ruinous and bloody, followed
by ill feeling, and ever liable to recur. Colonial states, in which the
first settlers usually allotted the land (or most of it) among themselves
and handed down their allotments to their children, were particularly
exposed to troubles of this kind. The various fortunes of families, and
the coming of new settlers, early raised the land-question there in an
acute form, as notoriously at Syracuse. No wonder that practical and
theoretical statesmen tried to find remedies for a manifest political
evil. Stability was only to be assured by internal peace. To this end
two main lines of policy<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> found favour. Security of tenure was promoted
by forbidding the sale of land-lots or making it difficult to
encumber them by mortgages: while the prohibition of excessive
acquisition<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> was a means of checking land-grabbers and interesting a
larger number of citizens in the maintenance of the land-system. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
there is no reason to think that measures of this kind had much success.
Nor were vague traditions<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> of the equality of original land-lots in some
Greek states of any great importance. Some theoretical reformers
might aim at such an arrangement, but it was a vain aspiration. Indeed,
regarded from the food-producing point of view, nothing like a true
equality was possible in practice. Confiscation and redistribution were
only to be effected at the cost of civil war, and the revered wisdom of
Solon<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> had rejected such a proceeding. Communistic schemes had
little attraction for the average Greek, so far as his own labour or
interests might be involved: even the dream of Plato was far from a
thoroughgoing communism.</p>

<p>Of the farmer in his character of citizen<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Aristotle had a favourable
impression formed from the experience of the past. The restless activity
of Assemblies frequently meeting, and with fees for attendance, was
both a cause and an effect of the degeneration of democracies in his
day. It meant that political issues were now at the mercy of the
ignorant and fickle city-dwellers, a rabble swayed by the flattery of self-seeking
demagogues. Athens was the notable instance. Yet tradition
alleged (and it can hardly be doubted) that in earlier times, when a
larger part of the civic body lived and worked in the country, a soberer
and steadier policy<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> prevailed. The farmers, never free from responsibilities
and cares, were opposed to frequent Assemblies, to attend
which involved no small sacrifice of valuable time. For this sacrifice
a small fee would have been no adequate compensation, and in fact
they had none at all. Naturally enough Aristotle, admitting<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> that in
the states of his day democratic governments were mostly inevitable,
insists on the merits of the farmer-democracies of the good old times,
and would welcome their revival. But the day for this was gone by,
never to return. Another important point arises in connexion with
the capacity of the state for war, a point seldom overlooked in Greek
political speculation. In discussing the several classes out of which the
state is made up, Aristotle observes<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> that individuals may and will
unite in their own persons the qualifications of more than one class.
So the same individuals may perform various functions: but this does
not affect his argument, for the same persons may be, and often are,
both hoplites and cultivators, who yet are functionally distinct parts
of the state. Just below, speaking of the necessity of ‘virtue’ (ἀρετὴ)
for the discharge of certain public duties (deliberative and judicial), he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
adds ‘The other faculties may exist combined in many separate individuals;
for instance, the same man may be a soldier a cultivator and
a craftsman, or even a counsellor of state or a judge; but all men claim
to possess virtue, and think they are qualified to hold most offices. But
the same men cannot be at once rich and poor. The common view
therefore is that Rich and Poor are the true <i>parts</i> of a state.’ That
is to say, practical analysis can go no further. In another passage<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>,
discussing the formation of the best kind of democracy, he says ‘for
the best Demos is that of farmers (ὁ γεωργικός): so it is possible to
form (a corresponding?) democracy where the mass of the citizens gets
its living from tillage or pasturage (ἀπὸ γεωργίας ἢ νομῆς).’ After considering
the political merits of the cultivators, busy and moderate men,
he goes<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> on ‘And after the Demos of cultivators the next best is that
where the citizens are graziers (νομεῖς) and get their living from flocks
and herds (βοσκημάτων): for the life in many respects resembles that
of the tillers of the soil, and for the purposes of military campaigning
these men are peculiarly hardened<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> by training, fit for active service,
and able to rough it in the open.’ The adaptability of the rustic worker
is further admitted<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> in a remark let fall in a part of his treatise where
he is engaged in designing a model state. It is to the effect that, so
long as the state has a plentiful supply of farm-labourers, it must also
have plenty of seamen (ναυτῶν). Having just admitted that a certain
amount of maritime commerce will be necessary, and also a certain
naval power, he is touching on the manning of the fleet. The marine
soldiers will be freemen, but the seamen (oarsmen) can be taken from
unfree classes working on the land. Their social status does not at
this stage concern us: that such labourers could readily be made into
effective oarsmen is an admission to be noted. To the philosopher
himself it is a comfort to believe that he has found out a way of doing
without the turbulent ‘seafaring rabble’ (ναυτικὸς ὄχλος) that usually
throngs seaport towns and embarrasses orderly governments. In other
words, it is a relief to find that in a model state touching the sea it
will not be necessary to reproduce the Peiraeus.</p>

<p>In considering the proposals of earlier theorists for the remedy of
political defects it is hardly possible and nowise needful to exhaust all
the indications of dissatisfaction with existing systems. Of Euripides
and Socrates, the two great questioners, enough has been said above.
The reactionary Isocrates was for many years a contemporary of
Aristotle. What we can no longer reproduce is the talk of active-minded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
critics in the social circles of Athens. It happens that Xenophon has
left us a sketch of the ordinary conversations of Socrates. No doubt
these were the most important examples of their kind, and his method
a powerful, if sometimes irritating, stimulus to thought. But we are
not to assume a lack of other questioners, acute and even sincere, more
especially among men of oligarchic leanings. That Aristotle came into
touch with such persons is probable from his connexion with Plato.
Certain passages in the <i>Constitution of Athens</i>, in which he is reasonably
suspected<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> of giving a partisan view of historical events, point to the
same conclusion. We shall never know all the criticisms and suggestions
of others that this watchful collector heard and noted. But it is
both possible and desirable to recall those to which his own record
proves him to have paid attention.</p>

<p>Both Hippodamus and Plato based their schemes on a class-system,
in which the farmer-class form a distinct body: but the former made
them citizens with voting rights. Being unarmed, and so at the mercy
of the military class, Aristotle held that their political rights were
nugatory. In the <i>Republic</i>, Plato gave them no voice in state-affairs,
but in the <i>Laws</i> he admitted them to the franchise. While these two
reformers made provision for a military force, Phaleas, ignoring relations
with other states, made none. To Phaleas, equality in landed estate
seemed the best means of promoting harmony and wellbeing in the
community; and he would effect this equality by legal restrictions.
This proposition Aristotle rejected as neither adequate nor suited to
its purpose. Moral<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> influences, hard work, discretion, even intellectual
activity, can alone produce the temper of moderation that promotes
concord and happiness. In short, if you are to effect any real improvement,
you must start from the doctrine of the Mean<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> and not trust to
material equalizing. The several tenure of land-lots was generally
recognized, with variations in detail; Plato in the <i>Laws</i> abandoned
the impracticable land-system of the <i>Republic</i>, and not only assigned
a κλῆρος to each citizen household, but arranged it in two<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> sections,
for reasons given above. The attempt to ensure the permanence of the
number of land-lots and households by strict legal regulation, as some
legislators had tried to do, is also a general feature of these speculations.
Plato in the <i>Laws</i> even went further, and would place rigid restrictions
on acquisition of property of all kinds. All agree in the usual Greek
contempt for those engaged in manual or sedentary trades. Such
‘mechanical’ (βάναυσοι) workers were held to be debased in both body
and mind below the standard of ‘virtue’ required of the good soldier
or citizen. Phaleas made these ‘artisans’ public slaves <i>de iure</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Hippodamus placed them, with the farmers, in nominal citizenship but
<i>de facto</i> bondage. Plato tolerates them because he cannot do without
them. In the matter of hard bodily labour, free or slave, the position
of Plato is clear. He would devolve it upon slaves; in agriculture, with
a coexisting alternative system of serf-tenants. But both classes are to
be Barbarians. It seems that Hippodamus meant the public, if not the
private, land of his model state to be worked by slaves. Most striking
is the fact that Plato in his later years combined the aim of self-sufficiency
with dependence on servile labour. Commerce is, for the
moral health of the state, to be strictly limited. The supply of necessary
food-stuffs is to be a domestic industry, carried on by alien serfs or slaves
for the most part. Such communism as exists among the Guardians
in the <i>Republic</i> is a communism of consumers who take no part in
material production: and it is abandoned in the <i>Laws</i>.</p>

<p>The above outlines must suffice as a sketch of the situation both in
practice and in theory when Aristotle took the matter in hand. The
working defects of Greek constitutions were obvious to many, and the
incapacity of the ignorant masses in democracies was especially evident
to thoughtful but irresponsible critics. Yet the selfishness of the rich
in oligarchies was not ignored, and the instability of governments
supported by only a minority of the citizens was an indisputable fact.
The mass of citizens (that is, full members of the state according to
the qualification-rules in force) had to come in somewhere, to give
numerical strength to a government. How was governing capacity to
be placed in power under such conditions? Experience suggested that
things had been better for Athens when a larger part of her citizens
lived on the land. Use could no doubt be made of this experience in
case an opening for increasing the number of peasant farmers<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> should
occur. But it was precisely in states where such a policy was most
needed that an opening was least likely to occur. It would seem then
that the only chance of improving government lay in persuading the
average citizen to entrust wider powers to a specially selected body of
competent men, in short to carry into politics the specializing principle<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
already developed by the advance of civilization in other departments.
Now the average citizen was certain to test the plans of reformers by
considering how their operation would affect cases like his own. It
was therefore necessary to offer him a reassuring picture of projects of
this kind, if they were to receive any hearing at all. To own a plot of
land, inalienable and hereditary, was a security against indigence. To
have the labour of cultivating it performed as a matter of course by
others was a welcome corollary. To be relieved of mechanical drudgery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
by aliens and slaves was a proposal sure to conciliate Greek pride.
And the resulting leisure for the enlightened discharge of the peculiarly
civic functions of war and government was an appeal to self-esteem
and ambition. But that the creation of a ruling class of Guardians
with absolute power, such as those of Plato’s <i>Republic</i>, would commend
itself to democratic Greeks, was more than any practical man could
believe. Nor would the communism of those Guardians appear attractive
to the favourers of oligarchy. Therefore Plato himself had to
recast his scheme, and try to bring it out of dreamland by concessions
to facts of Greek life. Not much was gained thereby, and the great
difficulty, how to make a start, still remained. That much could be
done by direct legislative action was a tradition in Greek thought
fostered by tales of the achievements of early lawgivers. But to remodel
the whole fabric of a state so thoroughly that an entire change
should be effected in the political atmosphere in which the citizens
must live and act, while the citizens themselves would be the same
persons, reared in old conditions and ideas, was a project far beyond
the scope of ordinary legislation. To Aristotle it seemed that the
problem must be approached differently.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the two distinct lines taken by him;
first, that the character of the state depends on that of its members,
and secondly, that the individual only finds his true self as member of
a state. The subject has been fully<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> treated, better than I could treat
it; and in constructing a model there remains the inevitable difficulty,
where to begin. The highest development of the individual is only
attainable under the training provided by the model state, and this
state is only possible as an association of model citizens. If we may
conjecture Aristotle’s answer from a rule<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> laid down in the <i>Ethics</i>, he
would say ‘first learn by doing, and then you can do what you have
learnt to do.’ That is, effort (at first imperfect) will improve faculty,
and by creating habit will develope full capacity. But even so it would
remain uncertain whether the individual, starting on a career of self-improvement,
is to work up to the making of a model state, or the
imperfect state to start training its present citizens to perfection. The
practical difficulty is there still. Nor is it removed by putting the first
beginnings of training so early<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> that they even precede the infant
citizen’s birth, in the form of rules for eugenic breeding. Aristotle’s
procedure is to postulate favourable equipment, geographical and
climatic, a population of high qualities (that is, Greek,) and then to
consider how he would organize the state and train its members—if
the postulated conditions were realized and he had a free hand. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
this new Utopia it is most significant to observe what he adopts from
historical experience and the proposals of earlier theorists, and in what
respects he departs from them. It is in particular his attitude towards
ownership and tillage of land, and labour in general, that is our present
concern.</p>

<p>As it follows from his doctrine of the Mean that the virtue of the
state and its several members must be based on the avoidance of extremes,
so it follows<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> from the moral aim of the state that its component
elements are not all ‘parts’ of the state in the same strict sense.
Economically, those who provide food clothing etc are parts, necessary
to the existence of the community. Politically (for politics have a
moral end) they are below the standard of excellence required for a
share in the government of a perfect state. They cannot have the
leisure or the training to fit them for so responsible a charge. Therefore
they cannot be citizens. To maintain secure independence and
internal order the citizens, and the citizens only, must bear arms. And,
since the land must belong to the possessors of arms, none but citizens
can own land. This does not imply communism. There will have to
be public<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> land, from the produce of which provision will be made for
the service of religion and for the common tables at which citizens will
mess. To maintain these last by individual contributions would be
burdensome to the poor and tend to exclude them. For rich and poor
there will be. But the evil of extreme poverty will be avoided. There
will be private land, out of which each citizen (that is evidently each
citizen-household) will have an allotment of land. This κλῆρος will be
in two<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> parcels, one near the city and the other near the state-frontier,
so that issues of peace and war may not be affected by the bias of
local interests. The cultivation of these allotments will be the work
of subjects, either inhabitants of the district (περίοικοι) or slaves; in
any case aliens, not Greeks; and in the case of slaves care must be
taken not to employ too many of the same race together or such as
are high-spirited. He is concerned to secure the greatest efficiency
and to leave the least possible facilities for rebellion. The labourers
will belong to the state or to individual citizens according to the proprietorship
of the land on which they are severally employed. By these
arrangements he has provided for the sustenance of those who in the
true political sense are ‘parts’ of the state (πόλις), and for their enjoyment
of sufficient leisure<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> to enable them to conduct its government
in the paths of virtue and promote the good life (τὸ εὖ ζῆν) which is
the final cause of state existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>The citizens then have the arms and the land and all political
power. Among themselves they are on an equal footing, only divided
functionally according to age: deliberative and judicial duties belonging
to the elder men, military activities to the younger. It is impossible
to overlook the influence of the Spartan system on the speculations
of Aristotle as well as those of Plato. The equality of Spartan
citizens was regarded as evidence<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> of a democratic element in their
constitution, and we find this same theoretical equality among the
full citizens at any given moment in the developing constitution of
Rome. It is significant that Aristotle felt the necessity of such an
equality. He remarks<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> that the permanence of a constitution depends
on the will of the possessors of arms. We may observe that he
seldom refers to the mercenaries so commonly employed in his day,
save as his bodyguard of usurping tyrants. But in one passage<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> he
speaks of oligarchies being driven to employ them at a pinch for their
own security against the Demos, and of their own overthrow in consequence.
Therefore he did not ignore the risk run by relying on
hirelings: naturally he would prefer to keep the military service of
his model state in the hands of his model citizens. But he had no
belief<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> in the blind devotion of Sparta to mere preparation for warfare.
Peace is the end of war, not war of peace. If you do not learn
to make a proper use of peace, in the long run you will fail in war
also: hence the attainment of empire was the ruin of Sparta: she
had not developed the moral qualities needed for ruling in time of
peace. But in his model state he seems not to make adequate provision
for the numbers required in war. His agricultural labourers
are not to be employed in warfare, as the Laconian Helots regularly
were. He only admits them to the service of the oar, controlled by
the presence of marine soldiers, who are free citizens like the poorer
class of Athenians who generally served in that capacity. The servile
character of rustic labour on his plan is thus reasserted, and with it
the superior standing of land forces as compared with maritime.
The days were past when Athenians readily served at the oar in their
own triremes, cruising among the subject states and certain of an
obsequious reception in every port. Hired rowers had always been
employed to some extent, even by Athens: in this later period the
motive power of war-gallies of naval states was more and more obtained
from slaves. There was an economic analogy between farm-labour
and oar-labour. The slave was forced to toil for practically no more<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
than his food: the profits of the farm and the profits of war-booty
fell to be shared in either case by few.</p>

<p>Aristotle, who was well aware of the merits of the working farmer,
the peasant citizen, and recognized that such men had been a sound
and stable element in the Athens of former days, would surely not
have treated agriculture as a work reserved for servile hands, had he
not been convinced that the old rural economy was gone and could
never be revived. For, if suggestions from Sparta influenced him
when designing Utopian institutions, it is no less clear that the
Utopian setting—territory, city, port-town,—are merely modifications
of Attica, Athens, Peiraeus. In Greece there was no state so favoured
geographically, so well equipped by nature for independence prosperity
and power. If a Greek community was ever to realize an
artistic ideal, and live in peaceful and secure moderation a model
life of dignity and virtue, it could hardly have a better chance of
success than in some such advantageous position as that enjoyed by
Athens. Her defects lay in her institutions, such as he viewed them
at their present stage of development. These could not be approved
as they stood: they needed both political and economic reform. Into
the former we need not enter here: the later democracy could not
but disgust one who judged merit from the standpoint of his doctrine
of the Mean. Economically, we may infer from his own model project
that two great changes would be required. Citizens must all have an
interest in the land, though farmed by slave labour. The port-town
must no longer be a centre of promiscuous commerce, thronged with
a cosmopolitan population of merchants seamen dock-labourers etc
and the various purveyors who catered for their various appetites. In
truth the Peiraeus was a stumbling-block to him as to Plato, and
probably to most men<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> who did not themselves draw income from its
trade or its iniquities, or who did not derive political power from the
support of its democratic citizens. To have a state ‘self-sufficing’ so
far as to get its necessary food from its own territory, and to limit
commerce to a moderate traffic sufficient to procure by exchange such
things as the citizens wanted but could not produce (for instance<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
timber), was a philosopher’s aspiration.</p>

<p>While proposing to restrict commercial activity as being injurious
in its effect, when carried to excess, on the higher life of the state,
Aristotle like Plato admits<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> that not only slaves but free aliens, permanently
or temporarily resident, must form a good part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
population. He does not even<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> like Plato propose to fix a limit to
the permissible term of metic residence. Apparently he would let
the resident alien make his fortune in Utopia and go on living there
as a non-citizen of means. But he would not allow him to hold real
property within the state, as Xenophon or some other<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> writer had
suggested. That the services of aliens other than slaves were required
for the wellbeing of the state, is an important admission. For it
surely implies that there were departments of trade and industry in
which slave-labour alone was felt to be untrustworthy, while the model
citizens of a model state could not properly be so employed. The
power of personal interest<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> in promoting efficiency and avoiding waste
is an elementary fact not forgotten by Aristotle. Now the slave,
having no personal interest involved beyond escaping punishment, is
apt to be a shirker and a waster. The science of the master (δεσποτική)<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>,
we are told, is the science of using slaves; that is, of getting out of
them what can be got. It is a science of no great scope or dignity.
Hence busy masters employ overseers. He suggests that some
stimulus to exertion may be found in the prospect of manumission<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
for good service. This occurs again in the <i>Economics</i>, but the question
of what is to become of the worn-out rustic slave is not answered by
him<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> any more than it is by Plato. My belief is that, so far as farm
staffs are concerned, he has chiefly if not wholly in view cases<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> of stewards
overseers etc. These would be in positions of some trust, perhaps
occasionally filled by freemen, and to create in them some feeling of
personal interest would be well worth the masters while. Domestic
slavery was on a very different footing, but it too was often a worry<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
to masters. Here manumission played an obvious and important
part, and perhaps still more in the clerical staffs of establishments
for banking and other businesses. These phenomena of Athenian
life were interesting and suggestive. Yet Aristotle is even more
reticent<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> than Plato (and with less reason) on the subject of manumission:
which is matter for regret.</p>

<p>The model state then will contain plenty of free aliens, serving
the state with their talents and labour, an urban non-landholding
element. They set the model citizens free for the duties of politics
and war. Whether they will be bound to service in the army or the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
fleet, like the Athenian metics, we are not told. Nor is it easy to
guess how Aristotle would have answered the question. Their main
function is to carry on the various meaner or ‘mechanical’ trades
and occupations, no doubt employing or not employing the help of
slaves according to circumstances. All such trades were held to have
a degrading effect<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> on both body and mind, disabling those practising
them from attaining the highest excellence, that is the standard of
model citizens in war and peace. Aristotle finds the essence of this
taint in transgression of the doctrine of the Mean. Specialization
carried to extremes produces professionalism which, for the sake of
perfecting technical skill, sacrifices the adaptability, the bodily suppleness
and strength and the mental all-round alertness and serene
balance,—qualities which every intelligent Greek admired, and which
Aristotle postulated in the citizens of his model community. So
strong is his feeling on the point that it comes<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> out in connexion
with music. The young citizens are most certainly to have musical
training, but they are not to become professional performers; for this
sort of technical excellence is nothing but a form of βαναυσία.</p>

<p>If neither the farmer nor the artisan are to be citizens, and the
disqualification of the latter rests on his narrow professionalism, we
are tempted to inquire whether the claim of the farmer may not also
have been regarded as tainted by the same disability. That agriculture
afforded scope for a high degree of technical skill is a fact
not missed by Aristotle. He is at pains to point out<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> that this most
fundamental of industries is a source of profit if scientifically pursued,
as well as a means of bare subsistence. For the exchange<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> of products
(such as corn and wine) by barter soon arises, and offers great
opportunities, which are only increased to an injurious extent by the
invention of a metallic currency. Now the founder of the Peripatetic
school was not the man to ignore the principles of scientific farming,
and the labour of collecting details had for him no terrors. Accordingly
he refers to the knowledge<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> required in several departments of
pastoral and agricultural life. He sketches briefly the development
of the industry, from the mere gathering of nature’s bounty, through
the stage of nomad pasturage, to settled occupation and the raising
of food-crops by tillage of the soil. But in the <i>Politics</i> he does not
follow out this topic. His preoccupation is the development of man
in political life: so he dismisses further detail with the remark<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
(referring to the natural branch of χρηματιστική, the art of profit-making,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
which operates with crops and beasts) that in matters of this
kind speculation is liberal (= worthy of a free man) but practice is not.
This seems to imply that to be engrossed in the detailed study of
various soils or breeds of beasts, with a view to their appropriate and
profitable management, is an illiberal and cramping pursuit. He
does not apply to it the term βαναυσία, and the reason probably is
that the bodily defects of the sedentary artisan are not found in the
working farmer. But the concentration upon mean details of no
moral or political significance is common to both. That all unskilled<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
wage-earners fall under the same ban is a matter of course, hardly
worth mentioning. In short, all those who depend on the custom of
others for a living are subject to a sort of slavery in a greater or less
degree, and unfit to be citizens.</p>

<p>The value attached to ‘self-sufficiency’ as evidence of freedom
and of not living ‘in relation to another’ (that is, in dependence<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> on
another,) is in striking contrast to views that have enjoyed a great
vogue in modern economic theory. Neither the man nor the state
can be completely<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> self-sufficing: that Aristotle, and Plato before
him, saw. Man, feeling his way upward through the household to
the state, needs help. He first finds<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> a helper (I am omitting the sex-union)
in the ox, the forerunner of the slave, and still in primitive
rustic life the helper of the poor. Growing needs bring division of
labour and exchange by barter, and so on. As a political animal he
can never be quite independent as an individual, but it is the law of
his being that the expanding needs which draw him into association
with his fellows result in making him more of a man. Here lies a
pitfall. If through progress in civilization his daily life becomes so
entangled with those of other men that his freedom of action is
hampered thereby, surely he has lost something. His progress has
not been clear gain, and the balance may not be easy to strike. It is
therefore a problem, how to find a position in which man may profit
by the advantages of civilization without risking the loss of more
than he has gained. Aristotle does not state it in terms so brutally
frank. But the problem is there, and he does in effect attempt a
solution. The presence in sufficient numbers of slaves legally unfree,
and workers legally free but virtually under a defined or special kind<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
of servitude (ἀφωρισμένην τινὰ δουλείαν), is the only means by which
a privileged class can get all the good that is to be got out of human
progress. His model citizens are an aristocracy of merited privilege,
so trained to virtue that to be governed by them will doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
enable their subjects to enjoy as much happiness as their inferior
natures can receive. This solution necessitates the maintenance of
slavery<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> as existing by nature, and the adoption of economic views
that have been rightly called reactionary. The student of human
nature and experience unwisely departed from the safer ground of
his own principles and offered a solution that was no solution at all.</p>

<p>As the individual man cannot live in complete isolation, supplying
his own needs and having no relations with other men,—for his manhood
would thus remain potential and never become actual—so it
will be with the state also. It must not merely allow aliens to reside
in it and serve its purposes internally: it will have to stand in some
sort of relations to other states. This is sufficiently asserted by the
provision made for the contingency of war. But in considering how
far a naval force would be required<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> in his model state he remarks
‘The scale of this force must be determined by the part (τὸν βίον)
played by our state: if it is to lead a life of leadership and have
dealings with other states (ἡγεμονικὸν καὶ πολιτικὸν βίον), it will need
to have at hand this force also on a scale proportioned to its activities.’
Then, jealous ever of the Mean, he goes on to deny the necessity of
a great ‘nautical rabble,’ in fact the nuisance of the Peiraeus referred
to above. On the protection of such maritime commerce as he would
admit he does not directly insist; but, knowing Athens so well, no
doubt he had it in mind. Another illustration of the virtuous Mean
may be found in the rules of education. The relations of the quarrelsome
Greek states had been too often hostile. The Spartan training
had been too much admired. But it was too one-sided, too much a
glorification of brute force, and its inadequacy had been exposed
since Leuctra. Its success had been due to the fact that no other
state had specialized in preparation for war as Sparta had done. Once
others took up this war-policy in earnest, Sparta’s vantage was gone.
This vantage was her all. Beaten in war, she had no reserve of non-military
qualities to assuage defeat and aid a revival. The citizens of
Utopia must not be thus brutalized. Theirs must be the true man’s
courage (ἀνδρία)<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>, as far removed from the reckless ferocity of the
robber or the savage as from cowardice. It is surely not too much to
infer<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> that military citizens of this character were meant to pursue a
public policy neither abject nor aggressive.</p>

<p>It is in connexion with bodily training that we come upon views
that throw much light on the position of agricultural labour. There is,
he remarks, a general agreement<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> that gymnastic exercises do promote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
manly courage, or as he puts it below ‘health and prowess.’ But at the
present time there is, in states where the training of the young is made a
special object, a tendency<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> to overdo it: they bring up the boys as
regular athletes, producing a habit of body that hinders the shapely
development and growth of the frame. The Thebans in particular are
thought to be meant. His own system does not thus run to excess.
Gentle exercises gradually extended will develop fine bodies to match
fine souls. Now his labouring classes receive no bodily training of the
kind. The frame of the artisan is left to become cramped and warped
by the monotonous movements of his trade. So too the farm-labourer
is left to become hard and stiff-jointed. Neither will have the supple
agility needed for fighting as an art. We have seen that this line had
already been taken by Plato in the <i>Republic</i>; indeed it was one that a
Greek could hardly avoid. Yet the shock-tactics of heavy columns
were already revolutionizing Greek warfare as much as the light troops
organized by Iphicrates. Were Aristotle’s military principles not quite
up to date? Philip made the Macedonian rustic into a first-rate soldier.
But the northern tribesman was a free man. The rustic of the model
state was to be a slave or serf: therefore he could not be a soldier. To
keep him in due subjection he must not be allowed to have arms or
trained to use them skilfully. This policy is nothing more or less than
the precautionary device<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> resorted to in Crete; the device that he twits
Plato with omitting in the <i>Republic</i>, though without it his Guardians
would not be able to control the landholding Husbandmen. And yet
the weakness of the Cretan system is duly noted<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> in its place. The
truth is, Aristotle was no more exempt from the worship of certain ill-defined
political terms than were men of far less intellectual power.
The democrat worshipped ‘freedom’ in the sense<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> of ‘do as you please,’
the mark of a freeborn citizen. The philosopher would not accept so
crude a doctrine, but he is none the less determined to mark off the
‘free’ from the unfree, socially as well as politically. Adapting an institution
known in Thessalian<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> cities, he would have two open ‘places’
(ἀγοραί) in his model state; one for marketing and ordinary daily
business, the other reserved for the free citizens. Into the latter no
tradesman (βάναυσον) or husbandman (γεωργόν), or other person of
like status (τοιοῦτον), is to intrude—unless the magistrates summon
him to attend.</p>

<p>It is a pity that Aristotle has left us no estimate of the relative
numerical strength of the various classes of population in Utopia. He
neglects this important detail more completely even than Plato. Yet
I fancy that an attempt to frame such an estimate would very soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
have exposed the visionary and unpractical nature of the whole fabric
constructed on his lines. It would, I believe, have been ultimately
wrecked on the doctrine of the Mean. Restriction of commerce had
to be reconciled with financial strength, for he saw that wealth was
needed<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> for both peace and war. This εὐπορία could only arise from
savings, the accumulated surplus of industry. The labouring classes
would therefore have to provide not only their own sustenance etc and
that of their rulers, but a considerable surplus as well. This would
probably necessitate so numerous a labouring population that the
citizens would have enough to do in controlling them and keeping
them to their work. To increase the number of citizens would add to
the unproductive<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> mouths, and so on. Foreign war would throw everything
out of gear, and no hiring of mercenaries is suggested. It is the
carrying to excess of the principle of specialization that demands excess
of ‘leisure,’ nothing less than the exemption of all citizens (all persons
that count, in short,) from manual toil. Yet it was one who well knew
the political merits of peasant farmers that was the author of this extravagant
scheme for basing upon a servile agriculture the entertainment
of a hothouse virtue.</p>

<p>The general effect produced by reviewing the evidence of Aristotle
on agriculture and the labour-question is that he was a witness of the
decay of the working-farmer class, and either could not or would not
propose any plan for reviving it. The rarity of the words αὐτουργὸς
and cognates is not to be wondered at in his works. They do not occur
in the <i>Politics</i>. The <i>Rhetoric</i> furnishes two<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> passages. One refers to
the kinds of men especially liable to unfair treatment (ἀδικία) because
it is not worth their while to waste time on legal proceedings, citing as
instances aliens and αὐτουργοί. Rustics may be included, but are not
expressly mentioned. The other<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> refers to qualities that men generally
like and respect, as justice. ‘Popular opinion finds this character in
those who do not make their living out of others; that is, who live of
their own labour, for instance those who live by farming (ἀπὸ γεωργίας),
and, in other pursuits, those most of all who work with their own hands.’
Here we have the working farmer expressly cited as a type worthy of
respect. But to single him out thus certainly does not suggest that the
type was a common one. The great Aristotelian index of Bonitz
supplies three<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> more passages, all from the little treatise <i>de mundo</i>.
They occur in a special context. God, as the cause that holds together
the universe, is not to be conceived as a power enduring the toil of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
self-working laborious animal (αὐτουργοῦ καὶ ἐπιπόνου ζῴου). Nor
must we suppose that God, seated aloft in heaven and influencing all
things more or less directly in proportion as they are near or far, pervades
and flits through the universe regardless of his dignity and
propriety to carry on the things of earth with his own hands (αὐτουργεῖ
τὰ ἐπὶ γῆς). The third passage is in a comparison, illustrating the
divine power by the Persian system, in which the Great King sitting
on his throne pervades and directs his vast empire through his ministering
agents. Such <i>a fortiori</i> is the government of God.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">XVIII. THE LATER ATTIC ORATORS.</h3>

<p>It has already been remarked that no clear chronological line can
be drawn to divide this famous group into two sections, but that there
is nevertheless a real distinction between the period of hostility to
Persia and that in which fear of Macedon was the dominant theme.
The jealousies and disunion of the Greek states are the background of
both. Isocrates<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> had appealed in vain for Greek union as a means of
realizing Greek ambitions and satisfying Greek needs. Demosthenes,
so far as he did succeed in combining Greek forces to resist the encroachments
of Philip, succeeded too late. In the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> we
see the Greek states grouped under two great leading powers. The
conflict of these powers leaves one of them the unquestioned head of
the Greek world. The next half century witnessed the fall of Sparta,
earned by gross misgovernment, and the rise and relapse of Thebes.
In the same period Athens made another bid for maritime empire, but
this second Alliance had failed. Isolation of Greek states was now the
rule, and the hopelessness of any common policy consummated the
weakness of exhaustion. At Athens the old fervent patriotism was
cooling down, as we learn from the growing reluctance to make sacrifices
in the country’s cause. Demos was no longer imperial, and he
was evidently adapting himself to a humbler role. His political leaders
had to secure his food-supply and provide for his festivals, and this
out of a sadly shrunken income. To provide efficient fighting forces
on land and sea was only possible by appropriating the Festival fund
(θεωρικόν), and the mob of Athens was unwilling either to fight in
person or to surrender its amusements in order to hire mercenaries.
Too often the result was that mercenaries, hired but not paid, were left
to pillage friend and foe alike for their own support. The truth is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
individualism was superseding old-fashioned patriotism. The old simple
views of life and duty had been weakened by the questionings of many
thinkers, and no new moral footing had yet been found to compete
with immediate personal interest. Athens was the chief centre of this
decline, for the intellectual and moral influences promoting it were
strongest there: but it was surely not confined to Athens. The failure
of Thebes after the death of Epaminondas was one of many symptoms
of decay. She had overthrown Sparta, but she could not herself lead
Greece: her utmost achievement was a fatal equilibrium of weak states,
of which the Macedonian was soon to take full advantage. And everywhere,
particularly in rural districts, the flower of the male population
was being drained away, enlisting in mercenary armies, lured by the
hope of gain and willing to escape the prospect of hard and dreary lives
at home. In short, each was for his own hand.</p>

<p>Such an age was not one to encourage the peaceful and patient toil
of agriculture. The great cities, above all Athens, needed cheap corn.
Their own farmers could not supply this, and so importation<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> was by
law favoured, and as far as possible inforced. Thus times of actual
dearth seldom occurred, and home-grown corn was seldom a paying
crop. Thrown back all the more on cultivation of the olive and vine
the products of which were available for export, the farmer needed time
for the development of his planted (πεφυτευμένη) land, and the waiting
for returns necessitated a larger capital. He was then exposed to risk
of greater damage in time of war. For his capital was irretrievably
sunk in his vineyard or oliveyard, and its destruction would take years
to repair—that is, more waiting and more capital. This was no novel
situation. But its effect in reducing the number of small peasant farmers
was probably now greater than ever. Not only were mercenary armies
relentless destroyers and robbers (having no fear of reprisals and no
conventional scruples to restrain them), but their example corrupted
the practice of citizen forces. Even if no fighting took place in this or
that neighbourhood, the local farmers<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> must expect to be ruined by the
mere presence of their own defenders. When we bear in mind the risks
of drought in some parts or floods in others, the occasional losses of
live stock, and other ordinary misfortunes, it is fair to imagine that the
farmer of land needed to be a man of substance, not liable to be ruined
by a single blow. And the sidelights thrown on the subject by the
indirect references in the orators are quite consistent with this view.</p>

<p>The loss of the Thracian Chersonese in the disasters of 405 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
not only dispossessed the Athenian settlers there, but made that region
a source of continual anxiety to Athens. She was no longer in secure
control of the strait through which the corn-ships passed from the
Pontus. A considerable revival of her naval power enabled her in 365
to occupy the island of Samos and to regain a footing in the Chersonese.
To both of these cleruchs were sent. But the tenure of the Chersonese
was disputed by Thracian princes, and it was necessary to send frequent
expeditions thither. The success or failure of these enterprises
is recorded in histories of Greece. The importance of the position
justified great efforts to retain it. Greek cities on the Propontis and
Bosporus, not Thracian chiefs only, gave trouble. If short of supplies,
as in 362, they were tempted to lay hands<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> on the corn-ships, and consume
what was meant for Athens. But the result of much confused
warfare was that in 358 the Chersonese became once more a part of the
Athenian empire. Even after the dissolution of that empire in the war
with the Allies 358-6, part of the peninsula still remained Athenian.
But it was now exposed to the menace of the growing power of Macedon
under Philip. To induce the Demos, who needed the corn, to
provide prompt and adequate protection for the gate of Pontic trade,
was one of the many difficult tasks of Demosthenes.</p>

<p>Demosthenes is by far the most important witness to the circumstances
of his age; though much allowance must be made for bias and
partisan necessities, this does not greatly affect references to agricultural
matters. Unfortunately his supreme reputation caused the works
of other authors to be attributed to him in later times. Thus the total
number of speeches passing under his name is a good deal larger than
that of the undoubtedly genuine ones. But, if we set aside a few mere
forgeries of later rhetoricians, the speeches composed by contemporary
authors are no less authorities for stray details of rural life than those
of Demosthenes himself. It is therefore not necessary to discuss questions
of authorship, on which even the ablest specialists are often not
agreed. But it is of interest to bear in mind that we are gleaning little
items, from a strictly Athenian point of view, bearing on the condition
of the same Athens and Attica as came under the cool observation of
the outsider Aristotle. The lives of Aristotle and Demosthenes, from
384-3 to 322 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, are exactly contemporary. And, as in matters of
politics the speeches of the orators often illustrate the philosopher’s
criticisms of democracy, so it is probable that the matters of food-supply
and rural economy, referred to by speakers for purposes of the
moment, were among the particulars noted by Aristotle when forming
his conclusions on those subjects.</p>

<p>The right of owning real estate in Attica being reserved for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Athenian citizens, aliens were debarred from what was sometimes a
convenient form<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> of investment. If the possible return on capital so
placed was lower than in more speculative ventures, the risk of total
loss was certainly much less, of partial loss comparatively small.
Moreover it gave the owner a certain importance<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> as a citizen of known
substance. It enabled a rich man to vary<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> his investments, as references
to mixed estates shew. And he had a choice of policies in dealing
with it: he could reside on his own property and superintend the
management himself, or entrust the charge to a steward, or let it to a
tenant. And, if at any time he wanted ready money for some purpose,
he could raise it by a mortgage on favourable terms. If the land lay
in a pleasant spot not too far from the city, he was tempted to make
himself a ‘place in the country’ for his own occasional retirement and
the entertainment of friends. That landowning presented itself to
Athenians of the Demosthenic period in the aspects just sketched is
manifest from the speeches belonging to the years from 369 to 322 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>.
Of the small working farmer there is very little trace. But that some
demand for farms existed seems indicated by the cleruchs sent to the
Chersonese and Samos. No doubt these were meant to serve as resident
garrisons at important points, and it is not to be supposed that they
were dependent solely on their own labour for tillage of their lots.
Another kind of land-hunger speaks for itself. The wars and wastings
of this period placed large areas of land at the disposal of conquerors.
Olynthian, Phocian, Boeotian territory was at one time or another
confiscated and granted out as reward for this or that service. No
reproaches of Demosthenes are more bitter than the references to these
cruel and cynical measures of Philip’s corrupting policy. Individuals
shared<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> these and other spoils: the estates of Aeschines and Philocrates
in Phocis, and later of Aeschines in Boeotia, are held up as the shameful
wages of treachery. These estates can only have been worked by
slave-labour under stewards, for politicians in Athens could not reside
abroad. They are specimens of the large-scale agriculture to which the
circumstances of the age were favourable.</p>

<p>A dispute arising out of a case of challenge to exchange properties<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
(ἀντίδοσις), in order to decide which party was liable for performance
of burdensome state-services, gives us a glimpse of a large holding in
Attica. It belongs to 330 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> or later. The farm is an ἐσχατιά, that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
a holding near<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> the frontier. It is stated to have been more than 40
stadia (about 5 miles) in circuit. The farmstead included granaries
(οἰκήματα) for storing the barley and wheat which were evidently the
chief crops on this particular farm. It included also a considerable
vineyard producing a good quantity of wine. Among the by-products
was brushwood (ὕλη, not timber ξύλα)<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>. The faggots were carried to
market (Athens, I presume) on the backs of asses. The ass-drivers are
specially mentioned. The returns from the faggot-wood are stated at
over 12 drachms a day. The challenging speaker declares that this
estate was wholly unencumbered: not a mortgage-post (ὅρος) was to
be seen. He contrasts his own position, a man who has lost most of
his property in a mining venture, though he has even toiled with his
own<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> hands, with that of the landlord (I presume not an αὐτουργός)
enriched by the late rise of the prices of corn and wine. He may be
grossly exaggerating the profits of this border-farm: his opponent
would probably be able to cite very different facts from years when
the yield had been poor or prices low. Still, to impress an Athenian
jury, the picture drawn in this speech must at least have seemed a
possible one. The labour on the farm would be mainly that of slaves:
but to this I shall return below. In another speech<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> we hear of a farmer
in the far north, on the SE Crimean coast. The sea-carriage of 80 jars
of sour wine is accounted for by his wanting it for his farm-hands
(ἐργάται). Slaves are probably meant, but we cannot be sure of it in
that slave-exporting part of the world. At any rate he was clearly
farming on a large scale. If he was, as I suppose, a Greek settler, the
case is an interesting one. For it would seem to confirm the view of
Isocrates, that Greek expansion was a feasible solution of a felt need,
provided suitable territory for the purpose could be acquired; and that
of Xenophon, when he proposed to plant necessitous Greeks in Asiatic
lands taken from Persia.</p>

<p>The type of farmer known to us from Aristophanes, who works a
holding of moderate size, a man not wealthy but comfortable, a well-to-do
peasant proprietor who lives among the slaves whose labour he
directs, is hardly referred to directly in the speeches of this period.
Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> in 355 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> makes the general remark ‘You cannot deny
that farmers who live thrifty lives, and by reason of rearing children
and domestic expenses and other public services have fallen into arrear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
with their property-tax, do the state less wrong than the rogues who
embezzle public funds.’ But he does not say that there were many
such worthy citizen-farmers, nor does he (I think) imply it. In a
similar passage<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> three years later he classes them with merchants,
mining speculators, and other men in businesses, as better citizens than
the corrupt politicians. Such references are far too indefinite, and too
dependent on the rhetorical needs of the moment, to tell us much. In
one of the earlier private speeches<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Demosthenes deals with a dispute
of a kind probably common. It is a neighbours’ quarrel over a wall,
a watercourse, and right of way. To all appearance the farms interested
in the rights and wrongs were not large holdings. They were evidently
in a hilly district. The one to protect which from floods the offending
wall had been built had at one time belonged to a ‘town-bred<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> man’
who disliked the place, neglected it, and sold it to the father of
Demosthenes’ client. There is nothing to shew that this farm was the
whole of the present owner’s estate: so that it is hardly possible to
classify him economically with any exactitude. We do by chance learn
that he had a staff of slaves, and that vines and fig-trees grew on the
land.</p>

<p>The author of one of the earlier speeches<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> (between 368 and 365
<span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) furnishes much more detail in connexion with estates of what was
apparently a more ordinary type. Neighbours are quarrelling as usual,
and we have of course only <i>ex parte</i> statements. The farms, worked
by slave-labour, produce vines and olives and probably some corn also.
The enclosure and tending of valuable plants is represented as kept
up to a high standard. Incidentally we learn that the staff used to
contract<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> for the gathering of fruit (ὀπώραν) or the reaping and carrying
of other crops (θέρος ἐκθερίσαι), clearly on other estates. The
contract was always made by a person named, who is thereby proved
to have been the real owner of these slaves,—a point in the case. According
to his own account, the speaker had for some time been settled
(κατῴκουν) on the estate. That is, he had a house there and would
sometimes be in residence. The amenities of the place are indicated
by the mention of his young rose-garden, which was ravaged by trespassers,
as were his olives and vines. The house from which they
carried off ‘all the furniture, worth more than 20 minas,’ seems to have
been in Athens, and the mention of the lodging-house (συνοικία) that
he mortgaged for 16 minas shews that his estate was a mixed one.
Country houses were no exceptional thing. A mining speculator speaks
of an opponent<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> as coming to his house in the country and intruding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
into the apartments of his wife and daughters. A party protesting
against being struck off the deme-register says<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> that his enemies made
a raid on his cottage in the country (οἰκίδιον ἐν ἀγρῷ). He is probably
depreciating the house, in order not to have the dangerous appearance
of a rich man.</p>

<p>We hear also of farms near Athens, the suburban position of which
no doubt enhanced their value. In the large mixed estate inherited
and wasted by Timarchus, <b>Aeschines</b><a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> mentions (344 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) a farm only
about a mile and a half from the city wall. The spendthrift’s mother
entreated him to keep this property at least: her wish was to be buried
there. But even this he sold, for 2000 drachms (less than £80). In
the speech against Euergus and Mnesibulus the plaintiff tells<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> how his
opponents raided his farm and carried off 50 soft-wooled sheep at
graze, and with them the shepherd and all the belongings of the flock,
also a domestic slave, etc. This was not enough: they pushed on into
the farm and tried to capture the slaves, who fled and escaped. Then
they turned to the house, broke down the door that leads to the garden
(κῆπον), burst in upon his wife and children, and went off with all the
furniture that remained in the house. The speaker particularly points
out<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> that he had lived on the place from childhood, and that it was near
the race-course (πρὸς τῷ ἱπποδρόμῳ). It must then have been near
Athens. The details given suggest that it was a fancy-farm, devoted
to the production of stock valued for high quality and so commanding
high prices. The garden seems to be a feature of an establishment
more elegant than that of a mere peasant farmer. It corresponds to
the rose-bed in a case referred to above: <b>Hyperides</b><a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> too mentions a
man who had a κῆπος near the Academy, doubtless a pleasant spot.
The farm in the plain (ὀ ἐν πεδίῳ ἀγρός)<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> belonging to Timotheus, and
mortgaged by him to meet his debts, is only mentioned in passing
(362 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) with no details: we can only suppose it to have been an
average holding in the rich lowland.</p>

<p>A few passages require separate consideration in connexion with
the labour-question. In the speech on the Crown (330 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) Demosthenes
quotes<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Aeschines as protesting against being reproached with the
friendship (ξενίαν) of Alexander. He retorts ‘I am not so crazy as to
call you Philip’s ξένος or Alexander’s φίλος, unless one is to speak of
reapers or other wage-earners as the friends of those who hire them
... but on a former occasion I called you the hireling (μισθωτὸν) of
Philip, and I now call you the hireling of Alexander.’ Here the reaper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
(θεριστής) is contemptuously referred to as a mere hireling. Such was
the common attitude towards poor freemen who lived by wage-earning
labour,—θῆτες in short. But is it clear that the μισθωτὸς is necessarily
a freeman? The passage cited above from an earlier speech makes it
doubtful. If a gang of slaves could contract to cut and carry a crop
(θέρος μισθοῖντο ἐκθερίσαι), their owner acting for them, surely they
were strictly μισθωτοὶ from the point of view of the farmer who hired
them. They were ἀνδράποδα μισθοφοροῦντα, to use the exact Greek
phrase. In the speech against Timotheus an even more notable passage<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
(362 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) occurs. Speaking of some copper said to have been taken in
pledge for a debt, the speaker asks ‘Who were the persons that brought
the copper to my father’s house? Were they hired men (μισθωτοί),
or slaves (οἰκέται)?’ Here, at first sight, we seem to have the hireling
clearly marked off as free. For the argument<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> proceeds ‘or which of
my slave-household (τῶν οἰκετῶν τῶν ἐμῶν) took delivery of the
copper? If slaves brought it, then the defendant ought to have handed
them over (for torture): if hired men, he should have demanded our
slave who received and weighed it.’ Strictly speaking, slaves, in status
δοῦλοι, are οἰκέται<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> in relation to their owner, of whose οἰκία they form
a part. But if <i>A</i> in a transaction with <i>B</i> employed some slaves whom
he hired for the purpose from <i>C</i> (<i>C</i> being in no way personally
involved in the case), would not these<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> be μισθωτοί, in the sense that
they were not his own οἰκέται, but procured by μισθὸς for the job? It
is perhaps safer to assume that in the case before us the hirelings
meant by the speaker are freemen, but I do not think it can be considered
certain. Does not their exemption from liability to torture
prove it? I think not, unless we are to assume that the slaves hired
from a third person, not a party in the case, could be legally put to
question. That this was so, I can find no evidence, nor is it probable.
The regular practice was this: either a party offered his slaves for examination
under torture, or he did not. If he did not, a challenge
(πρόκλησις) was addressed to him by his opponent, demanding their
surrender for the purpose. But to demand the slaves of any owner,
not a party in the case, was a very different thing, and I cannot discover
the existence of any such right. I am not speaking of state
trials, in which the claims of the public safety might override private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
interests, but of private cases, in which the issue lay between clearly
defined adversaries. In default of direct and unquestionable authority,
I cannot suppose that an Athenian slaveowner could be called upon
to surrender his property (even with compensation for any damage
thereto) for the purposes of a case in which he was not directly concerned.</p>

<p>Stray references to matters of land-tenure, such as the letting of
sacred lands<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> (τεμένη) belonging to a deme, are too little connected
with our subject to need further mention here. And a curious story<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
of some hill-lands (ὄρη) in the district of Oropus, divided by lot
among the ten Tribes, apparently as tribal property, is very obscure.
Such allotments would probably be let to tenants. What is more
interesting in connexion with agriculture is the references to farming
as a means of getting a livelihood, few and slight though they are.
Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> in 349 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> tells the Assembly that their right policy is
to attack Philip on his own ground, not to mobilize and then await
him in Attica: such mobilization would be ruinous to ‘those of you
who are engaged in farming.’ The speech against Phaenippus<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> shews
us an establishment producing corn and wine and firewood and alleged
to be doing very well owing to the prices then ruling in the market.
We have also indications of the presence of dealers who bought up
crops, no doubt to resell at a profit. From the expressions<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> ὀπώραν
πρίασθαι and ὀπωρώνης it might seem that fruit-crops in particular
were disposed of in this way. Naturally a crop of this sort had to be
gathered quickly, and a field gang would be employed—slaves or
freemen, according to circumstances. For that in these days poverty
was driving many a free citizen<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> to mean and servile occupations for
a livelihood, is not only a matter of certain inference but directly
affirmed by Demosthenes in 345 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. Aeschines<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> in 344 also denies
that the practice of any trade to earn a bare living was any political
disqualification to a humble citizen of good repute. From such poor
freemen were no doubt drawn casual hands at critical moments of
farm life, analogues of the British hop-pickers<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>. But, with every
allowance for possible occasions of employing free labour, particularly
in special processes where servile apathy was plainly injurious, the
farm-picture in general as depicted in these speeches is one of slave-labour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
And this suggests to me a question in reference to the disposal
of Greek slaves. For the vast majority of slaves<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> in Greece, whether
urban or rustic, were certainly Barbarians of several types for several
purposes. The sale of the people of captured cities had become quite
an ordinary thing. Sparta had sinned thus in her day of power, and
the example was followed from time to time by others. The cases of
Olynthus in 348 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> and Thebes in 335 fall in the present period.
Aeschines mentions<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> some captives working chained in Philip’s vineyard;
but these can only have been few. The mass were sold, and a
large sum of money realized thereby. At Thebes the captives sold
are said to have numbered 30,000. What markets absorbed these
unhappy victims? I can only guess that many found their way to
Carthage and Etruria.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIX">XIX. THE MACEDONIAN PERIOD 322-146 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>.</h3>

<p>The deficiency of contemporary evidence illustrating the agricultural
conditions of this troubled age in the Greek world makes it necessary
to combine the various scraps of information in a general sketch.
Hellas had now seen its best days. The break-up of the great empire
of Alexander did not restore to the little Greek states the freedom of
action which had been their pride and which had been a main influence
in keeping up their vitality. The outward and visible sign of their
failure was the impossibility of an independent foreign policy. The
kingdoms of Alexander’s Successors might rise and fall, but Greek
states could do little to affect the results. A new world was opened
to Greek enterprise in the East, and Greek mercenaries and Greek
secretaries traders and officials were carrying the Greek language and
civilization into wide lands ruled by Macedonian kings. But these
were individuals, attracted by the prospect of a gainful military or
civil career. Either they settled abroad, and drained Greece of some
of her ablest sons; or they returned home enriched, and formed an
element of the population contrasting painfully with those who had
stayed behind. In either case it seems certain that the movement
tended to lower the standard of efficiency and patriotism in their native
states. Citizen armies became more and more difficult to maintain.
The influx of money no longer locked up in Oriental treasuries only
served to accentuate the old social distinction<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> of Rich and Poor. Men
who came back with fortunes meant to enjoy themselves, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
did: the doings of the returned soldier of fortune were proverbial, and
a fruitful theme for comic poets. But the spectacle of wanton luxury
was more likely to lure enterprising individuals into ventures abroad
than to encourage patient industry at home. And there is little doubt
that such was the general result. The less vigorous of the poor citizens
remained, a servile mob, ever ready by grovelling compliments to earn
the bounties of kings.</p>

<p>Political decay and changes of social circumstance were accompanied
by new movements in the sphere of thought. It is generally
observed that in this period philosophy more and more appeals to the
individual man, regardless of whether he be a citizen or not. How far
this movement arose out of changed conditions may be open to
difference of opinion: but, as usual in human affairs, what began as an
effect continued to operate as a cause. The rapid spread of the Greek
tongue and Greek civilization eastwards, known as Hellenizing, was
a powerful influence promoting cosmopolitan views. Alien blood could
no longer form an unsurmountable barrier: the Barbarian who spoke
Greek and followed Greek ways had won a claim to recognition, as had
already been foreseen by the mild sincerity<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> of Isocrates. But these
half-Greeks, some of them even of mixed blood, were now very
numerous. They competed with genuine Hellenes at a time when the
pride of the genuine Hellene was ebbing: even in intellectual pursuits,
in which the Hellene still claimed preeminence, they were serious and
eventually successful rivals. It is no wonder that earlier questionings
took new life, and that consciousness of common humanity tended to
modify old-established sentiment, even on such subjects as the relation
of master and slave. It was not merely that the philosophic schools
from different points of view, Cynic Cyrenaic Stoic Epicurean, persistently
regarded man as a mental and moral unit, whatever his
political or social condition might be. The fragments and echoes of
the later Comedy suffice to shew how frankly the slave could be presented
on the public stage as the equal, or more than equal, of his master.</p>

<p>The foundation of new cities by the Successor-kings was another
influence acting in the same direction. These were either royal capitals
or commercial centres, or both, like Alexandria. Others were important
from their situation as strategic posts, such as Lysimacheia by
the Hellespont or Demetrias commanding the Pagasaean gulf. Competing
powers could not afford to wait for gradual growth; so great
efforts were made to provide populations for the new cities without
delay. Sometimes multitudes were transplanted wholesale from older
communities. In any case no strict inquiry into the past condition of
transplanted persons can have taken place. In Sicily we know that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
Syracuse had become the one great centre of what remained of Greek
power in that island. But, what with incorporation of foreign mercenaries
and enfranchisement of slaves, what with massacres of Greek
citizens, the population of Syracuse was a mongrel mob. Such, if in
a less degree, were the populations of the new cities of the kings.
There was nothing national about them. In some, for instance
Alexandria, a rabble wavering between apathy and ferocity was a
subject of concern to the government. Others were more noted as
centres of industry: such were some of those in Asia Minor. But
common to them all was the condition, a momentous change from a
Greek point of view, of dependence. They were not states, with a
policy of their own, but parts of this or that kingdom. However little
their overlord might interfere with their internal affairs, still it was he,
not they, that stood in relation to the world outside. They were not
independent: but as a rule they were prosperous. In the new world
of great state-units they filled a necessary place, and beside them the
remaining state-cities of the older Greek world were for the most part
decaying. These for their own protection had to conform their policy
to that of some greater power. Patriotism had little material in which
to find expression: apathy and cosmopolitan sentiment were the inevitable
result. Such was in particular the case at Athens, which
remained eminent as a centre of philosophic speculation, attracting
inquirers and students from all parts. But the ‘fierce democraty’ of
her imperial days was a thing of the past, and she lived upon her
former glories and present subservience.</p>

<p>If academic distinction and cosmopolitanism went easily together,
commercial activity was hardly likely to foster jealous state-patriotism
of the old sort. The leading centre of commerce in the eastern
Mediterranean was Rhodes. The island city was still a state. Its convenient
position as a port of call on the main trade routes gave it
wealth. Its usefulness to merchants from all parts enabled it to play
off the kings against one another, and to enjoy thereby much freedom
of action. Its steady conservative government and its efficient navy
made it a welcome check on piracy in time of peace, and a valued ally
in war. It was also a considerable intellectual centre. No power was
so closely in touch with international questions generally, or so often
employed as umpire in disputes. Till an unfortunate blunder at the time
of the war with Perseus (168 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) put an end to their old friendship with
Rome, and led to their humiliation, the wise policy of the Rhodians
preserved their independence and earned them general goodwill. But
it was surely not in a state thriving on trade and traffic that the old
narrow Greek patriotism could find a refuge. It is not necessary to
refer to more cases in particular. The main point of interest is that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
this age of cities and extensive maritime intercourse urban life was
generally developing and rural life shrinking. Now it had been, and
still was, the case that mixture of population normally took place in
active cities, especially in seaport towns. It was in quiet country towns
and hamlets that native purity of blood was most easily preserved.</p>

<p>If the general outline of circumstances has been fairly sketched in
the above paragraphs, we should expect to find that agriculture on a
small scale was not prospering in this period. Unhappily there is hardly
any direct evidence on the point. Even indirect evidence is meagre
and sometimes far from clear. One notable symptom of the age is seen
in the rise of bucolic poetry. This is not a rustic growth, the rude
utterance of unlettered herdsmen, but an artificial product of town-dwelling
poets, who idealize the open-air life to amuse town-bred
readers somewhat weary of the everlasting streets. In the endeavour
to lend an air of reality to scenes of rural life, it was convenient to
credit the rustics (shepherds goatherds etc) with a grossness of amorosity
that may perhaps be exaggerated to suit the taste of urban readers.
Of this tendency the idylls of Theocritus furnish many instances.
We need not accept them as accurate pictures of the life of herds and
hinds in Sicily or elsewhere, but they give us some notion of the ideas
of rural life entertained by literary men of the Alexandrian school.
Beside the guardians of flocks and herds with their faithful dogs, their
flutes and pan-pipes, idling in the pleasant shade and relieving the
tiresome hours with musical competition, we have the hinds ploughing
mowing or busy with vintage and winepress. Some are evidently freemen,
others are slaves; and we hear of overseers. There is milking and
making of cheese, and woodmen<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> are not forgotten. The bloom of
flowers, the murmur of streams, the song of birds, the whisper of the
refreshing breeze, form the setting of these rural scenes, and might
almost persuade us that we are privileged spectators of a genuine golden
age. But the sayings and doings of the rustics undeceive us. And the
artificiality of this poetry is further betrayed by that of the panegyric and
pseudo-epic poems of the same author. His admiration of Hiero<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> of
Syracuse may be mainly sincere, but his praises of Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Philadelphus
are the utterances of a courtier. His excursions into the region
of mythology are brief, for the reading public of his day could not stand
long epics on the adventures<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> of Heracles or the Dioscuri. And the
literary apparatus is antiquarian, a more or less direct imitation of the
old Homeric diction, but unable to reproduce the varied cadences. It
is generally remarked that the genius of Theocritus finds its happiest
and liveliest expression in the fifteenth idyll, which depicts urban
scenes. In this respect that idyll may be compared with the mimes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
<b>Herodas</b>, which illustrate, probably with truth, the shadier sides of urban
life in cities of the period, which Theocritus ignores.</p>

<p>It is in a miniature epic<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> of mythological setting that we find the
most direct references to tillage of the soil combined with the keeping
of live stock—general agriculture, in short. We read of the plowman<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
in charge of the crops, of the hard-working diggers<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> (φυτοσκάφοι οἱ
πολυεργοί), of the herdsmen<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>, of an overseer<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
    or steward (αἰσυμνήτης).
The staff seems to consist entirely of slaves. But it is not easy to say
how far the picture is meant as a reproduction of the primitive labour-conditions
of the traditional Heroic age, how far the details may be
coloured by the conditions of Theocritus’ own day. In the Idylls we
find a shepherd, free presumably, in charge of a flock the property<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> of
his father. On the other hand ἐριθακὶς in one passage<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> seems not to
be a wage-earner, but a black slave. The ἐργάτης of the tenth idyll<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> is
probably a free man, but he is enamoured of a slave girl. No conclusion
can be drawn from a reference<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> to coarse but filling food meant
for labourers. Roughness and a certain squalor are conventional rustic
attributes: a town-bred girl repulses the advances of a herdsman<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> with
the remark ‘I’m not used to kiss rustics, but to press town-bred lips,’
and adds further detail. Nor is the mention of Thessalian<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> serfs
(πενέσται) in the panegyric of Hiero anything more than a part of the
poet’s apparatus. And the reference<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> to the visit of Augeas to his
estate, followed by a comment on the value of the master’s personal
attention to his own interests, is a touch of truism common to all
peoples in every age. To Theocritus, the one poet of learned Alexandria
who had high poetic genius, the life and labour of farmers was
evidently a matter of little or no concern. He could hardly idealize
the Egyptian fellah. And the one passage<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> in which he directly illustrates
the position of the Greek contemporary farmer is significant.
Discontented owing to a disappointment in love, the man is encouraged
by his friend to enter the service of the generous Ptolemy as a mercenary
soldier.</p>

<p>One or two small references may be gleaned from the <i>Characters</i>
of Aristotle’s successor <b>Theophrastus</b>. That the bulk of these typical
portraits are drawn from town-folk is only to be expected, but this
point is not to be pressed overmuch, for philosophers did not frequent
country districts. The general references to treatment of slaves, the
slave-market, and so forth, are merely interesting as illustrative of the
general prevalence of slavery, chiefly of course in Athens. But we do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
get to the farm in the case<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> of the rustic boor (ἄγροικος). His lack of
dignity and proper reserve is shewn in talking to his slaves on matters
of importance: he makes confidants of them, and so far forgets himself
as to lend a hand in grinding the corn. It has been remarked that
Greek manners allowed a certain familiarity<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> in the relations of master
and slave. But this person overdoes it: in Peripatetic language, he
transgresses the doctrine of the Mean. He employs also hired men
(μισθωτοί), and to them he recounts all the political gossip (τὰ ἀπὸ
τῆς ἐκκλησίας), evidently a sign of his awkwardness and inability to
hold his tongue. I take these wage-earners to be poor freemen. They
might be slaves hired from another owner: this practice appears elsewhere
in connexion with town slaves. But the general impoverishment
of the old Greece, save in a few districts, is beyond doubt: and the
demand for slaves in new cities would raise the price of slaves and tend
to drive the free poor to manual labour.</p>

<p>The exact dates of the birth and death of <b>Polybius</b> are uncertain,
but as an observer of events his range extended from about 190 or 189
to 122 or 121 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. Though his references to agriculture are few and
separately of small importance, they have a cumulative value on certain
points. He wrote as historian of the fortunes of the civilized world of
his day, treated as a whole, in which a series of interconnected struggles
led up to the supremacy of Rome. His Greece is the Greece of the
Leagues. No leading state of the old models had been able to unite
the old Hellas effectively under its headship, but the Macedonian
conquest had plainly proved that in isolation<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> the little separate states
had no future open to them but slavery. The doings of Alexander’s
Successors further inforced the lesson. It was clear that the only hope
of freedom lay in union so far as possible, for thus only could Greek
powers be created able to act with any sort of independence and
self-respect in their relations with the new great powers outside.
Accordingly there took place a revival of old local unions in districts
where a community of interest between tribes or cities had in some
form or other long been recognized. Such were the tribal League of
Aetolia and the city League of Achaia. But these two were but notable
instances of a federative movement much wider. The attempt to unite
the scattered towns of Arcadia, with a federal centre at Megalopolis,
seems to have been less successful. But the general aim of the movement
towards federalism in Greece is clear. That it did not in the end
save Greek freedom was due to two defects: it was too partial and too
late. For no general union was achieved. Greek jealousy remained,
and Leagues fought with Leagues in internal strife: then they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
drawn into quarrels not their own, as allies of great foreign powers.
It was no longer possible to remain neutral with safety. No League
was strong enough to face the risk of compromising itself with a victorious
great power. Achaean statesmen did their best, but they too
could not save their country from ruin, once the League became entangled
in the diplomacy of Rome. Nor was it the old Hellas alone
that thus drifted to its doom. Between Rome and Carthage the western
Greeks lost whatever power and freedom their own disunion and
quarrels had left them. The Rhodian republic and its maritime League
of islanders had to become the subject allies of Rome.</p>

<p>One point stands out clearly enough. In the Greece of the third
century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> the question of food-supply was as pressing as it had
ever been in the past. The operations of King Philip were often conditioned
by the ease or difficulty of getting supplies<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> of corn for his
troops: that is, he had to work on an insufficient margin of such
resources. In 219, after driving the Dardani out of Macedonia, he had
to dismiss his men<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> that they might get in their harvest. In 218, the
success of his Peloponnesian campaign was largely dependent<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> on the
supplies and booty captured in Elis, in Cephallenia, in Laconia; and
on the subsidies of corn and money voted by his Achaean allies. The
destruction of crops<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> was as of old a principal means of warfare. And
when he had to meet the Roman invasion in 197, the race to secure
what corn<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> was to be had was again a leading feature of the war. It
is true that the feeding of armies was a difficulty elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>, as in
Asia, and in all ages and countries: also that difficulties of transport
were a considerable part of it. But the war-indemnities<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> fixed by
treaties, including great quantities of corn, shew the extreme importance
attached to this item. And the gifts of corn<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> to the Rhodian
republic after the great earthquake (about 225 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>), and the leave
granted them<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> in 169 by the Roman Senate to import a large quantity
from Sicily, tell the same story. Another article in great demand, only
to be got wholesale from certain countries, such as Macedonia, was
timber. It was wanted for domestic purposes and for construction of
military engines, which were greatly developed in the wars of the
Successors; but above all for shipbuilding, commercial and naval.
Rhodes in particular<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> needed a great supply; and the gifts of her
friends in 224 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> were largely in the form of timber. There was no
doubt a great demand for it at Alexandria, Syracuse, Corinth, and
generally in seaport towns. It is evident that in strictly Greek lands
the wood grown was chiefly of small size, suitable for fuel. There is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
no sign of an advance on the conditions of an earlier time in the way
of afforestation: nor indeed was such a policy likely.</p>

<p>But food had to be found somehow. Agriculture therefore had to
go on. Outside the commercial centres, where food-stuffs could be
imported by sea, there was no alternative: the population had to
depend on the products of local tillage and pasturage. A few cities
celebrated as art-centres might contrive to live by the sale of their
works, but this hardly affects the general situation. We should therefore
very much like to know how things stood on the land. Was the
tendency towards large landed estates, or was the small-farm system
reviving? Was farm-labour chiefly that of freemen, or that of slaves?
If of freemen, was it chiefly that of small owners, or that of wage-earners?
In default of any authoritative statement, we have to draw
what inferences we can from slight casual indications. That the
career of Alexander was directly and indirectly the cause of great
disturbances in Greek life, is certain. Of the ways in which it operated,
two are of special importance. The compulsory restoration of exiles<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
whose properties had been confiscated led to claims for restitution;
and in the matter of real estate the particular land in question was
easily identified and made the subject of a bitter contest. Now uncertainty
of tenure is notoriously a check on improvement, and the
effect of the restorations was to make tenures uncertain. At the same
time the prospects of professional soldiering in the East were a strong
temptation to able-bodied husbandmen who were not very prosperous.
From the rural parts of Greece a swarm of mercenaries went forth to
join the host of Alexander, and the movement continued long. In the
stead of one Alexander, there arose the rival Successor-kings, who
competed in the military market for the intelligent Greeks. It was
worth their while, and they paid well for a good article. So all through
the third century there was a draining away of some of the best blood
of Greece. Some of these men had no doubt parted with farms before
setting out on the great venture. Of those who survived the wars,
some settled down abroad as favoured citizens in some of the new
cities founded by the kings. The few who returned to Greece with
money saved did not come home to labour on a small farm: they settled
in some city where they could see life and enjoy the ministrations of
male and female slaves. Now it is not likely that all lands disposed
of by these men were taken up by husbandmen exposed to the same
temptations. Probably the greater part were bought up by the
wealthier residents at home, and so went to increase large holdings.</p>

<p>How far do stray notices bear out this conclusion? At Athens in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
322 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> a constitution was imposed by Antipater, deliberately framed
for the purpose of placing power in the hands of the richer classes.
He left 9000 citizens in possession of the full franchise, excluding
12000 poor. For the latter he offered to provide allotments of land in
Thrace. Accounts<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> vary, but it seems that some accepted the offer
and emigrated. It was not a compulsory deportation, but it was exile.
Economically it may have been a relief to Athens by reducing the
number of citizens who shared civic perquisites. But it had no tendency
to bring more citizens back on to Attic land: such a move
would have implied displacement of present landholders, whom it was
Antipater’s policy to conciliate. In the course of the third century
we get a glimpse of the agrarian situation at Sparta. It is clear that
the movement, already noted by Aristotle, towards land-monopoly<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
in the hands of a few rich, had been steadily going on. It ended by
provoking a communistic reaction under the reforming kings Agis IV
and Cleomenes III. Blood was shed, and Sparta became a disorderly
state, the cause of many troubles in Greece down to the time of the
Roman conquest. The growing Achaean League, in the side of which
revolutionary Sparta was a thorn, was essentially a conservative
federation. However democratic its individual members might be,
the constitution of the League worked<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> very effectively in the interest
of the rich. On the occasion of the capture of Megalopolis by Cleomenes
<b>Polybius</b> is at pains to warn his readers<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> against believing
stories of the immense booty taken there. Though the Peloponnese
had enjoyed a period of prosperity, still these stories are gross exaggerations.
Megalopolis, an important member of the League, had
been from the first laid out on too ambitious<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> a scale. That the ‘Great
City’ was a great desert, had found proverbial expression in a verse.
A little later, when Philip was campaigning in Peloponnesus, we hear
of the great prosperity<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> of Elis, especially in agriculture. The Eleans
had enjoyed a great advantage in the protection afforded them by
religion as guardians of Olympia. We may add that they were allied
with the Aetolian League, whose hostility other Greek states were
not forward to provoke. A class of wealthy resident landlords existed
in Elis, and much of the country was good farming land under tillage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
But in most of the Achaean and Arcadian<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> districts pastoral industry,
and therefore sparse population, was the rule, owing to the mountainous
nature of those parts. In central Greece we need only refer to the
restored Thebes, centre once more of a Boeotian confederacy. The
fertile lowland of Boeotia supplied plenty of victual; and among Greek
delicacies the eels of the lake Copais were famous. Boeotians were
known as a well-nourished folk. In the fragments of the comic poet
Eubulus<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> (assigned to the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) we have them depicted
as gluttonous, with some grossness of detail. Such being their tradition,
I can see nothing strange in the picture<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> given of the Boeotians in his
own day by <b>Polybius</b>. The ceaseless guzzling, the idleness and political
corruption of the people, may be overdrawn. I admit that such qualities
were not favourable to lasting prosperity; but their prosperity was
not lasting. In the view of Polybius the subjection of Greece by the
Romans was rather an effect than a cause of Greek degeneracy, and I
dare not contradict him. Moreover a piece of confirmatory evidence
relative to the third century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> occurs in a fragment of <b>Heraclides
Ponticus</b>. In a traveller’s description<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> of Greece Boeotia is thus
referred to. Round Tanagra the land is not very rich in corn-crops,
but stands at the head of Boeotian wine-production. The people are
well-to-do, but live simply: they are all farmers (γεωργοί), not labourers
(ἐργάται). At Anthedon on the coast the people are all fishermen
ferrymen etc: they do not cultivate the land, indeed they have none.
Of Thebes he remarks that the territory is good for horse-breeding, a
green well-watered rolling country, with more gardens than any other
Greek city owns. But, he adds, the people are violent undisciplined
and quarrelsome. I think we may see here an earlier stage in the
degeneracy that disgusted Polybius.</p>

<p>In all this there is nothing to suggest that small farming was
common and prosperous during the Macedonian period in Greece.
The natural, inference is rather that agriculture in certain favoured
districts was carried on by a limited number of large landowners on a
large scale, pastoral industry varying locally according to circumstances.
The development of urban life and luxury, and the agrarian troubles
in the Peloponnese, are both characteristic phenomena of the age. In
town and country alike the vital fact of civilization was the conflict
of interests between rich and poor. Macedonia presents a contrast.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
There no great cities drew the people away from the country. A
hardy and numerous population supplied the material for national
armies whenever needed, and loyalty to the reigning king gave unity
to national action. Hence the long domination of Macedon in Greece;
the only serious opposition being that of the Aetolian League. Of all
the Successor-kingdoms, Macedon alone was able to make any stand
against the advance of Rome.</p>

<p>It remains to consider the few indications—I can hardly call them
references—from which we can get a little light on the labour-question.
The passages cited from Theophrastus and Theocritus point to the
prevalence of slave-labour. And the same may be said of <b>Polybius</b>.
In speaking<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> of the blunder in exaggerating the value of the booty
taken at Megalopolis, he says ‘Why, even in these more peaceful and
prosperous days you could not raise so great a sum of money in all
the Peloponnese out of the mere movables (ἐπίπλων) unless you took
slaves into account (χωρὶς σωμάτων).’ His word for live-stock not
human is θρέμματα. Evidently to him slave-property is a large item in
the value of estates. Again, speaking of the importance of Byzantium<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
on the Pontic trade-route, he insists on the plentiful and useful supply
of bestial and human stock to Greece by this traffic. The high farming
of rural Elis<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> is shewn in its being full of σώματα and farm-stock
(κατασκευῆς). Hence these ‘bodies’ formed a considerable part of the
booty taken there by Philip. And in the claims<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> made at Rome in
183 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> against Philip a part related to slave-property. References to
the sale of prisoners of war, to piracy and kidnapping, are frequent:
but they only concern us as indicating time-honoured means of supplying
the slave-market. As for rowing ships, so for heavy farm-work,
able-bodied men were wanted. At a pinch such slaves could be, and
were, employed in war<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>, with grant or promise of manumission: but
this was a step only taken in the last resort. A curious remark<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> of
<b>Polybius</b> when speaking of Arcadia must not be overlooked. In
220 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> an Aetolian force invaded Achaia and penetrated into northern
Arcadia, where they took the border town of Cynaetha, and after
wholesale massacre and pillage burnt it on their retreat. The city had
for years suffered terribly from internal strife, in which the doings of
restored exiles had played a great part. Polybius says that the
Cynaethans were thought to have deserved the disaster that had now
fallen upon them. Why? Because of their savagery (ἀγριότητος).
They were Arcadians. The Arcadians as a race-unit (ἔθνος) enjoy a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
reputation for virtue throughout Greece, as a kindly hospitable and
religious folk. But the Cynaethans outdid all Greeks in cruelty and
lawlessness. This is to be traced to their neglect of the time-honoured
Arcadian tradition, the general practice of vocal and instrumental music.
This practice was deliberately adopted as a refining agency, to relieve
and temper the roughness and harshness incidental to men living toilsome
lives in an inclement climate. Such was the design of the old
Arcadians, on consideration of the circumstances, one point in which
was that their people generally worked in person (τὴν ἑκάστων αὐτουργίαν).
On this I need only remark that he is referring to the past, but
may or may not include the Arcadians of his own day: and repeat what
I have said before, that to be αὐτουργὸς does not exclude employment
of slaves as well. That there was still more personal labour in
rural Arcadia than in many other parts of Greece, is probable. But
that is all.</p>

<p>That the slavery-question was a matter of some interest in Greece
may be inferred from the pains taken by <b>Polybius</b><a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> to refute an assertion
of <b>Timaeus</b>, that to acquire slaves was not a Greek custom. The
context is lost, and we cannot tell whether it was a general assertion
or not. If general, it was no doubt nonsense. A more effective piece
of evidence is the report<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> of <b>Megasthenes</b>, who visited India early in
the third century. He told his Greek readers that in India slavery was
unknown. The contrast to Greece was of course the interesting point.
It is also affirmed<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> that in this period manumissions became more
common, as a result of the economic decline of Greece combined with
the moral evolution to be traced in the philosophic schools. Calderini,
from whom I take this, is the leading authority on Greek manumission.
And, so far as the records are concerned, the number of inscribed
‘acts’ recovered from the important centre of Delphi<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> confirms the
assertion. From 201 to 140 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> these documents are exceptionally
numerous. But the not unfrequent stipulation found in them, that the
freed man or woman shall remain in attendance<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> on his or her late
owner for the owner’s life or for some fixed period, or shall continue
to practise a trade (or even learn a trade) on the profits of which the
late owner or his heirs shall have a claim, suggest strongly that these
manumissions were the rewards of domestic service or technical skill.
I do not believe that they have any connexion with rustic<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> slavery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Calderini also holds that as Greek industries and commerce declined
free labour competed more and more with slave-labour. So far as
urban trades are concerned, this is probably true: and likewise a certain
decline in domestic slavery due to the straitened circumstances
of families and experience of the waste and nuisance of large slave-households.
This last point, already noticed<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> e.g. by Aristotle, is to be
found expressed in utterances of the comic poets. Rustic slavery
appears in the fragments of Menander’s Γεωργός, but the old farmer’s
slaves are Barbarians, who will do nothing to help him when accidentally
hurt, and who are hardly likely to receive favours. The
ordinary view of agriculture in Menander’s time seems most truly expressed
in his saying<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> that it is a slave’s business.</p>

<p>Mention of the comic poets may remind us that most of the surviving
matter of the later Comedy has reached us in the Latin versions
and adaptations of <b>Plautus</b> and <b>Terence</b>. It is necessary to speak of
their evidence separately, in particular where slavery is in question,
for the relative passages are liable to be touched with Roman colouring.
In the case of manumission this is especially clear, but to pursue the
topic in detail is beyond my present purpose. The passages of <b>Plautus</b>
bearing on rustic life are not many, but the picture so far as it goes is
clear and consistent. In general the master is represented as a man of
means with a house in town and a country estate outside. The latter
is worked by slaves under a slave-bailiff or steward (<i>vilicus</i>). The
town-house is staffed by slaves, but the headman is less absolute than
the steward on the farm: departmental chiefs, such as the cook, are
important parts of the household. This is natural enough, for the
master generally resides there himself, and only pays occasional<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> visits
to the farm. The two sets of slaves are kept apart. If the steward<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> or
some other trusted farm-slave has to come to town, he is practically a
stranger, and a quarrel is apt to arise with leading domestics: for his
rustic appearance and manners are despised by the pampered menials.
But he is aware that his turn may come: some day the master in
wrath may consign the offending town-slave to farm-labour, and
then—. Apart from slavery, rustic life is regarded<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> as favourable to
good morals: honest labour, frugal habits, freedom from urban temptations,
commend it to fathers who desire to preserve their sons from
corrupting debauchery. In short, the urban moralist idealizes the farm.
Whether he would by choice reside there, is quite another thing. Clearly
the average young citizen would not. That the farm is occasionally used<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
as a retreat, is no more than a point of dramatic convenience. In one
passage<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> we have a picture of a small farm, with slave-labour employed
on it. Freemen as agricultural labourers hardly appear at all. But a
significant dialogue<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> between an old freeman and a young one runs
thus: ‘Country life is a life of toil.’ ‘Aye, but city indigence is far
more so.’ The youth, who has offered to do farm-work, is representative
of that class of urban poor, whose lot was doubtless a very miserable
one. Very seldom do we hear anything of them, for our records in
general only take account of the master and the slave. In the play
just referred to<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> there occur certain terms more or less technical. The
neutral <i>operarius</i> seems equivalent to ἐργάτης, and <i>mercennarius</i> to
μισθωτός, distinct from<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> <i>servus</i>. But these terms are not specially connected
with agriculture.</p>

<p>The references in <b>Terence</b> give us the same picture. An old man
of 60 or more is blamed<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> by a friend. ‘You have a first-rate farm and
a number of slaves: why will you persist in working yourself to
make up for their laziness? Your labour would be better spent in
keeping them to their tasks.’ The old man explains<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> that he is punishing
himself for his treatment of his only son. In order to detach the
youth from an undesirable amour, he had used the stock reproaches
of fathers to erring sons. He had said ‘At your time of life I wasn’t
hanging about a mistress: I went soldiering in Asia for a living, and
there I won both money and glory.’ At length the young man could
stand it no longer: he went off to Asia and entered the service of one
of the kings. The old man cannot forgive himself, and is now busy
tormenting himself for his conduct. He has sold off<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> all his slaves,
male or female, save those whose labour on the farm pays for its cost,
and is wearing himself out as a mere farm hand. Another<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> old farmer,
a man of small means who makes his living by farming, is evidently
not the owner but a tenant. Another<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> has gone to reside on his farm,
to make it pay; otherwise the expenses at home cannot be met. In
general country life is held up as a model<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> of frugality and industry.
In one passage<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> we hear of a hired wage-earner employed on a farm
(<i>a villa mercennarium</i>) whom I take to be a free man, probably employed
for some special service. Such are the gleanings to be got from
these Roman echoes of the later Attic comedy. I see no reason to
believe that they are modified by intrusion of details drawn from Italy.
The period in which Plautus and Terence wrote (about 230-160 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
included many changes in Roman life, particularly in agriculture. In
large parts of Italy the peasant farmers were being superseded by
great landlords whose estates were worked by slave-labour, and the
conditions of farm life as shewn by the Attic playwrights were not so
strange to a Roman audience as to need recasting. And we can only
remark that the evidence drawn from the passages above referred to
is in full agreement with that taken from other sources.</p>

<p>A very interesting sidelight on conditions in Greece, agriculture
included, towards the end of the third century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, is thrown by the
correspondence<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> of <b>Philip V of Macedon</b> with the authorities of
Larisa. An inscription found at Larisa preserves this important record.
Two points must first be noted, to give the historical setting of the
whole affair. Thessaly was under Macedonian overlordship, and its
economic and military strength a matter of concern to Philip, who had
succeeded to the throne of Macedon in 220 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. Moreover, the defeat
of Carthage in the first Punic war (264-41), the Roman occupation of
the greater part of Sicily and Sardinia, the Gallic wars and extension
of Roman dominion in Italy, the Illyrian war (230-29) and intervention
of Rome beyond the Adriatic, had attracted the attention of all the
Greek powers. The western Republic had for some years been carefully
watched, and the admission of Corcyra Epidamnus and Apollonia
to the Roman alliance was especially disquieting to the Macedonian
king. So in 219 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, just before the second Punic war, Philip sent <b>a
letter to Larisa</b>, pointing out that the number of their citizens had
been reduced by losses in recent wars and urging them to include in
their franchise the Thessalians and other Greeks resident in the city.
Among other advantages, the country<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> would be more fully cultivated.
The Larisaeans obeyed his injunctions. In 217 the war in Greece was
ended by his concluding peace with the Aetolians, his chief antagonists.
Hannibal was now in Italy, and the victory of Cannae in 216 raised
hopes in Philip of using the disasters of the Romans to drive them out
of Illyria. In 215 he concluded an alliance with Hannibal. The
Romans replied by naval activity in the Adriatic and later by stirring
up Greek powers, above all the Aetolians, to renew the war against
him. Meanwhile things had not gone on quietly at Larisa. The old
Thessalian noble families had given way to the king’s pressure unwillingly
for the moment, but internal troubles soon broke out. The
nobles regained control and annulled the recent concessions. Philip
therefore addressed to them a <b>second letter</b> in 214, censuring their
conduct, and calling upon them to give effect to the enfranchisement-policy
previously agreed to. Thus they would not only conform to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
decision as their overlord, but would best serve their own interests.
Their city would gain strength by increasing the number of citizens,
and they would not have their territory disgracefully<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> lying waste (καὶ
τὴν χώραν μὴ ὥσπερ νῦν αἰσχρῶς χερσεύεσθαι). He went on to refer
to the advantageous results of such incorporations elsewhere: citing
in particular the experience of Rome, whose growth and colonial expansion
were the fruits of a franchise-policy so generous as to grant
citizenship even to manumitted slaves. He called upon the Larisaeans
to face the question without aristocratic prejudice (ἀφιλοτίμως). And
the Larisaeans again complied.</p>

<p>Now here we have a glimpse of agricultural decline in one of the
most fertile parts of Greece. The stress laid upon it by Philip shews
that to him it seemed a very serious matter. He saw trouble coming,
and wished to keep his dependent allies strong. That his difficulty lay
in controlling the aristocratic families, who still retained much of their
former power, is clear. After his defeat in 197 the Romans restored<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
the aristocratic governments in Thessalian cities; indeed all through
the wars of this period in Greece the popular parties inclined to
Macedon, while the propertied classes favoured Rome. In Thessaly
the private estates of the nobles were cultivated by serfs. How would
an incorporation of more citizens tend to promote a fuller cultivation
of the land? I think we may take it for granted that the new citizens
were not expected to till the soil in person. That they were to have
unemployed serfs assigned to them, and so to enter the ranks of cultivating
landlords, is a bold assumption: for we do not know that there
were any unemployed serfs or that any distribution of land was contemplated.
I can only suggest that the effect of receiving citizenship
would be to acquire the right of holding real estate. Then, if we
suppose that there were at the time landed estates left vacant by the
war-casualties to which the king refers, and that each of these carried
with it a right to a certain supply of serf labour, we do get some sort
of answer to the question. But so far as I know this is nothing but
guesswork. More owners interested in the profits of farming would
tend, if labour were available, to employ more labour on the farms. In
short, we have evidence of the decay of agriculture in a particular
district and period, but as to the exact causes of this decay, and the
exact nature of the means proposed for checking it, we are sadly in
the dark.</p>

<p>The garden or orchard had always been a favourite institution in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
Greek life, and the growth of cities did not make it less popular. The
land immediately beyond the city walls was often laid out in this
manner. When Aratus in 251 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> took Sicyon and attached it to the
Achaean League, the surprise was effected by way of a suburban<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
garden. And we have no reason to suppose that holdings near a city
lacked cultivators. Even in the horrible period of confusion and bloodshed
at Syracuse, from the death of Dionysius the elder to the victory
of Timoleon, we hear<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> of Syracusans living in the country, and of the
usual clamour for redistribution of lands. In the endeavour to repopulate
the city an invitation to settlers was issued, with offer<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> of land-allotments,
and apparently the promise was kept. These notices suggest
that there was a demand for suburban holdings, but tell us nothing
as to the state of things in the districts further afield, or as to the class
of labour employed on the land. In any case Syracuse was a seaport,
and accustomed to get a good part of its supplies by sea. Very different
was the situation in Peloponnesus, where the up-country towns
had to depend chiefly on the produce of their own territories. There
land-hunger was ever present. The estates of men driven out in civil
broils were seized by the victorious party, and restoration of exiles at
once led to a fresh conflict over claims to restitution of estates. One of
the most difficult problems<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> with which Aratus had to deal at Sicyon
was this; and in the end he only solved it by the use of a large sum
of money, the gift of Ptolemy Philadelphus. The restored exiles on
this occasion are said to have been not less than 580 in all. They had
been expelled by tyrants who had in recent years ruled the city, and
whose policy it had evidently been to drive out the men of property—sworn
foes of tyrants—and to reward their own adherents out of confiscated
lands. To reverse this policy was the lifelong aim of Aratus.
In the generation following, the life of his successor Philopoemen gives
us a little light on agriculture from another point of view, that of the
soldier. He was resolved to make the army of the Achaean League an
efficient force. As a young man he concluded<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> that the Greek athletic
training was not consistent with military life, in which the endurance
of hardship and ability to subsist on any diet were primary necessities.
Therefore he devoted his spare time to agriculture, working<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> in person
on his farm, about 2½ miles from Megalopolis, sharing the labour and
habits of the labourers (ἐργατῶν). The use of the neutral word leaves
a doubt as to whether freemen or slaves are meant: taken in connexion
with the passages cited from Polybius, it is perhaps more likely that
the reference is to slaves. But the chief interest of the story as preserved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
by <b>Plutarch</b> lies in the discovery that, compared with athletes,
husbandmen are better military material.</p>

<p>The conclusions of Beloch<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> as to the population of Peloponnesus in
this period call for serious consideration. His opinion is that the number
capable of bearing arms declined somewhat since the middle of the
fourth century, though the wholesale emancipation of Spartan Helots
must be reckoned as an addition. But on the whole the free population
was at the beginning of the second century about equal to the joint
total of free and Helot population at the end of the fifth century. On
the other hand, the slave population had in the interval greatly increased.
He points to the importance of a slave corps<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> in the defence
of Megalopolis when besieged in 318 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>: to the Roman and Italian<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
slaves (prisoners sold by Hannibal) in Achaean territory, found and
released in 194 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, some 1200 in number: and to the levy<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> of manumitted
home-born slaves in the last struggle of the League against
Rome. I must say that this evidence, taken by itself, hardly seems
enough to sustain the great historian’s broad conclusion. But many of
the passages cited in preceding sections lend it support, and I am
therefore not disposed to challenge its general probability. It may be
added that increase in the number of slaves suggests an increase of large
holdings cultivated by slave labour; and that the breeding of home-born
(οἰκογενεῖς) slaves could be more easily practised by owners of a
large staff than on a small scale. Moreover the loss of slaves levied
for war purposes would fall chiefly on their wealthy owners. The men
of property were rightly or wrongly suspected of leaning to Rome, and
were not likely to be spared by the demagogues who presided over the
last frantic efforts of ‘freedom’ in Greece. The truth seems to be that
circumstances were more and more unfavourable to the existence of
free husbandmen on small farms, the very class of whose solid merits
statesmen and philosophers had shewn warm appreciation. The division
between the Rich, who wanted to keep what they had and get more,
and the Poor, who wanted to take the property of the Rich, was the
one ever-significant fact. And the establishment of Roman supremacy
settled the question for centuries to come. Roman capitalism, hastening
to exploit the world for its own ends, had no mercy for the small independent
worker in any department of life. In Greece under the sway
of Rome there is no doubt that free population declined, and the state
of agriculture went from bad to worse.</p>

<p>At this point, when the Greek world passes under the sway of Rome,
it is necessary to pause and turn back to consider the fragmentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
record of early Italian agriculture. This one great staple industry is
represented as the economic foundation of Roman political and military
greatness. No small part of the surviving Latin literature glorifies the
soundness of the Roman farmer-folk and the exploits of farmer-heroes
in the good old days, and laments the rottenness that attended their
decay. How far this tradition is to be accepted as it stands, or what
reservations on its acceptance should be made, and in particular the
introduction or extension of slave-labour, are the questions with which
it will be our main business to deal.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XX">XX. THE TRADITIONS COMBINED AND DISCUSSED.</h3>

<p>When we turn to Roman agriculture, and agricultural labour in
particular, we have to deal with evidence very different in character
from that presented by the Greek world. This will be most clearly
seen if we accept the very reasonable division of periods made by
Wallon in his <i>History of Slavery</i>—the first down to 201 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, the end of
the second Punic war, the second to the age of the Antonine emperors,
200 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> to the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>, and the third that
of the later Empire. For of the first we have no contemporary or
nearly contemporary pictures surviving. Traditions preserved by later
writers, notes of antiquaries on words and customs long obscured by
time and change, are the staple material at hand. Even with the help
of a few survivals in law, inference from such material is unavoidably
timid and incomplete. In collecting what the later Romans believed
of their past we get vivid impressions of the opinions and prejudices
that went to form the Roman spirit. But it does not follow that we
can rely on these opinions as solid evidence of facts. An instance may
be found in the assertion<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> that a clause requiring the employment of
a certain proportion of free labourers to slaves was included in the
Licinian laws of 367 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. This used to be taken as a fact, and inferences
were drawn from it, but it is now with reason regarded as an ‘anticipation,’
transferring the fact of a later attempt of the kind to an age in
which the slave-gangs were not as yet an evident economic and social
danger. In the second period, that of Roman greatness, we have not
only contemporary witness for much of the time in the form of references
and allusions in literature, but the works of the great writers on agriculture,
Cato Varro and Columella, not to mention the great compiler
Pliny, fall within it, and give us on the whole a picture exceptionally
complete. We know more of the farm-management and labour-conditions
in this period than we do of most matters of antiquity. The
last period sees the development of a change the germs of which are
no doubt to be detected in the preceding one. The great strain on the
Empire, owing to the internal decay and the growing pressure of
financial necessities, made the change inevitable; economic freedom
and proprietary slavery died down, and we have before us the transition
to predial serfdom, the system of the unfree tenant bound to the soil.
The record of this change is chiefly preserved in the later Roman Law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>My first business is therefore to inquire what the tradition of early
times amounts to, and how far it may reasonably be taken as evidence
of fact. And it must be borne in mind that my subject is not the technical
details of agriculture in general, but the nature of the labour
employed in agriculture. In ages when voluntary peace between
empires and peoples on <i>bona fide</i> equal terms was never a realized fact,
and as yet hardly a dream, the stability of a state depended on the
strength of its military forces,—their number, efficiency, and means of
renewal. Mere numbers<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> were tried and failed. The hire of professional
soldiers of fortune<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> might furnish technical skill, but it was politically
dangerous. Their leaders had no personal sentiment in favour of the
state employing them, and their interest or ambition disposed them
rather to support a tyrant, or to become tyrants themselves, than to
act as loyal defenders of the freedom of the state. Mercenaries<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> hired
in the mass, barbarians, were less skilled but not less dangerous. That
a well-trained army of citizens was the most trustworthy organ of state-protection,
was not disputed: the combination of loyalty with skill
made it a most efficient weapon. The ratio of citizen enthusiasm to
the confidence created by exact discipline varied greatly in the Greek
republics of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. But these two elements were normally
present, though in various proportions. The common defect, most
serious in those states that played an active part, was the smallness of
scale that made it difficult to keep up the strength of citizen armies
exposed to the wastage of war. A single great disaster might and did
turn a struggle for empire into a desperate fight for existence. The
constrained transition to employment of mercenary troops as the
principal armed force of states was both a symptom and a further cause
of decay in the Greek republics. For the sturdy soldiers of fortune
were generally drawn from the rustic population of districts in which
agriculture filled a more important place than political life. There is
little doubt that a decline of food-production in Greece was the result:
and scarcity of food had long been a persistent difficulty underlying
and explaining most of the doings of the Greeks. The rise of Macedon
and the conquests of Alexander proved the military value of a national
army of trained rustics, and reasserted the superiority of such troops
to the armed multitudes of the East. But Alexander’s career did not
leave the world at peace. His empire broke up in a period of dynastic
wars; for to supply an imperial army strong enough to support a single
control and guarantee internal peace was beyond the resources of
Macedonia.</p>

<p>If an army of considerable strength, easily maintained and recruited,
loyal, the servant of the state and not its master, was necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
defence and as an instrument of foreign politics, there was room for a
better solution of the problem than had been found in Greece or the
East. It was found in Italy on the following lines. An increase of
scale could only be attained by growth. Growth, to be effective, must
not consist in mere conquest: it must be true expansion, in other words
it must imply permanent occupation. And permanent occupation
implied settlement of the conquering people on the conquered lands.
A growing population of rustic citizens, self-supporting, bound by ties
of sentiment and interest to the state of which they were citizens, conscious
of a duty to uphold the state to which they owed their homesteads
and their security, supplied automatically in response to growing needs
the growing raw material of power. Nor was Roman expansion confined
to the assignation of land-allotments to individuals (<i>viritim</i>). Old
towns were remodelled, and new ones founded, under various conditions
as settlements (<i>coloniae</i>). Each settler in one of these towns received
an allotment of land in the territory of the township, and was officially
speaking a tiller of the soil (<i>colonus</i>). The effect of these Colonies was
twofold. Their territories added to the sum of land in occupation of
Romans or Roman Allies: so far the gain was chiefly material. But
they were all bound to Rome and subjected to Roman influences. In
their turn they influenced the conquered peoples among whom they
were planted, and promoted slowly and steadily the Romanizing of
Italy. Being fortified, they had a military value from the first, as
commanding roads and as bases of campaigns. But their moral effect
in accustoming Italians to regard Rome as the controlling centre of
Italy was perhaps of even greater importance.</p>

<p>We must not ignore or underrate the advantages of Rome’s position
from a commercial point of view. Little though we hear of this in
tradition, it can hardly be doubted that it gave Rome a marked superiority
in resources to her less happily situated neighbours, and enabled
her to take the first great step forward by becoming dominant in central
Italy. But the consolidation and completion of her conquest of the
peninsula was carried out by means of an extended Roman agriculture.
It was this that gave to Roman expansion the solid character that
distinguished republican Rome from other conquering powers. What
she took, that she could keep. When the traditional story of early
Rome depicts the Roman commons as hungry for land, and annexation
of territory as the normal result of conquest, it is undoubtedly worthy
of belief. When it shews us the devastation of their enemies’ lands as
a chief part—sometimes the whole—of the work of a campaign, it is in
full agreement with the traditions of all ancient warfare. When we
read<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> that the ruin of farms by raids of the enemy brought suffering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
farmers into debt, and that the cruel operation of debt-laws led to
serious internal troubles in the Roman state, the story is credible
enough. The superior organization of Rome enabled her to overcome
these troubles, not only by compromises and concessions at home, but
still more by establishing her poorer citizens on farms at the cost of
her neighbours. As the area under her control was extended, the
military force automatically grew, and she surpassed her rivals in the
cohesion and vitality of her power. At need, her armies rose from the
soil. So did those of other Italian peoples. But in dealing with them
she enjoyed the advantage of unity as compared with the far less
effective cooperation of Samnite cantons or Etruscan cities. Even the
capture of Rome by the Gauls could not destroy her system, and she
was able to strengthen her moral position by proving herself the one
competent defender of Italy against invasion from the North. When
the time came for the struggle with Carthage, she had to face a different
test. But no blundering on the part of her generals, no strategy of
Hannibal, could avail to nullify the solid superiority of her military
strength. And this strength was in the last resort derived from the
numbers and loyalty of the farm-population: it was in fact the product
of the plough rather than the sword.</p>

<p>The agricultural conditions of early Rome<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> are a subject, and have
been the subject, of special treatises. Only a few points can be noticed
here. That a communal system of some kind once existed, whether in
the form of the associations known to inquirers as Village Communities
or on a gentile basis as Clan-estates, is a probable hypothesis. But the
evidence for it is slight, and, however just the general inferences may
be, they can hardly be said to help us much in considering the labour-question.
It may well be true that lands<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> were held by clans, that they
were cultivated in common, that the produce was divided among the
households, that parcels of the land were granted to the dependants
(<i>clientes</i>) of the clan as tenants at will (<i>precario</i>) on condition of paying
a share of their crops. Or it may be that the normal unit was a village
in which the members were several freeholders of small plots, with
common rights over the undivided common-land, the waste left free
for grazing and miscellaneous uses. And it is possible that at some stage
or other of social development both these systems may have existed
side by side. In later times we find Rome the mistress of a vast territory
in Italy, a large part of which was reserved as state-domain (<i>ager
publicus populi Romani</i>), the mismanagement of which was a source of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
grave evils. But in Rome’s early days there cannot have been any
great amount of such domain-land. That there was land-hunger, a
demand for several allotments in full ownership, on which a family
might live, is not to be doubted. And the formation of communities,
each with its village centre and its common pasture, was a very natural
means to promote mutual help and protection. That men so situated
worked with their own hands, and that the labour was mainly (and
often wholly) that of the father and his family, is as nearly certain as
such a proposition can be. But this does not imply or suggest that no
slave-labour was employed on the farms. It merely means that farms
were not worked on a system in which all manual labour was performed
by slaves. We have to inquire what is the traditional picture of agricultural
conditions in the early days of Rome, and how far that picture
is worthy of our belief.</p>

<p>Now it so happens that, three striking figures stand out in the traditional
picture of the Roman farmer-soldiers of the early Republic.
Others fill in certain details, but the names of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus,
Manius Curius Dentatus, and Gaius Fabricius Luscinus, were
especially notable in Roman legend as representing the strenuous
patriotic and frugal lives of the heroes of old. The story of Cincinnatus<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
is told by Cicero Livy Dionysius and Pliny the elder, and often referred
to by other writers. The hero is a Patrician of the old simple frugal
patriotic masterful type, the admiration and imitation of which these
edifying legends seek to encourage. He had owned seven <i>iugera</i> of
land, but had been driven to pledge or sell three of these<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> in order to
provide bail for his son, who had been brought to trial for disturbance
of the public peace and had sought safety in flight. The forfeit imposed
on the father left him with only four <i>iugera</i>. This little farm, on the
further side of the Tiber, he was cultivating, when deputies from the
Senate came to announce that he had been named Dictator to deal with
a great emergency. They found him digging or ploughing, covered
with dust and sweat: and he would not receive them till he had washed
and gowned himself. Then he heard their message, took up the duties
of the supreme office, and of course saved the state. It is to be noted that
he chose as his Master of the Horse (the Dictator’s understudy) a man
of the same<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> sort, Patrician by birth, poor, but a stout warrior. We
may fairly suspect that a definite moral purpose has been at work,
modelling and colouring this pretty story. In a later age, when the
power of moneyed interests was overriding the prestige of Patrician
blood, the reaction of an ‘old-Roman’ party was long a vigorous force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
in Roman life, as we see from the career of the elder Cato. Cato was
a Plebeian, but any Plebeian who admired the simple ways of early
Rome was bound to recognize that Patricians were the nobility of the
olden time.</p>

<p>Now the fact of Cincinnatus working with his own hands is the one
material point in the story. We need not doubt that there were many
such men, and that a name (perhaps correct) was necessary in order to
keep the story current and to impress later generations with the virtues
of their ancestors. But, if the man had under him a slave or slaves, the
fact would be quite unimportant for the purpose of the legend. Therefore
it is no wonder that the versions of the story in general say nothing
of slaves. It is more remarkable that in the version of Dionysius we
read that Cincinnatus, after selling off most of his property to meet the
liabilities incurred through his son, ‘kept for himself one small farm
beyond the Tiber, on which there was a mean cabin: there he was
living a life of toil and hardship, tilling the soil with a few slaves.’
That Dionysius was a rhetorician with an eye for picturesque detail,
and liable to overdraw a picture, is certain: but it is not evident how
the mention of the slaves is to be accounted for by this tendency. The
impression of the hero’s poverty and personal labour is rather weakened
by mention of slaves. The writer derived his story from Roman sources.
Now, did the original version include the slaves or not? Did Livy and
the rest leave them out, or did Dionysius put them in? Were they
omitted as useless or embarrassing for the uses of edifying, or were
they casually inserted owing to the prepossessions of a Greek familiar
only with a developed slave-system, to whom ‘with a few slaves’ would
fitly connote poverty? To answer these questions with confidence is
perhaps unwise. But to me it seems far more likely that Roman
writers left the detail out than that a Greek student put it in.</p>

<p>If the tradition of the early wars is of any value at all, it may give
a general support to this opinion through the frequent references to
the existence of rustic slavery. The devastation of an enemy’s country
is the normal occupation of hostile armies. The capture of slaves<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>, as
of flocks and herds and beasts of burden, is a common item in the tale
of booty from the farms. That writers of a later age may have exaggerated
the slave-element in the farm-labour of early times is highly
probable. The picturesque was an object, and it was natural to attempt
it with the use of touches suggested by daily circumstances of the
world in which they were living. But that they so completely misrepresented
the conditions of a past age as to foist into the picture so
important a figure as the slave, without authority or probability, is
hardly to be believed, unless there is good reason for thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
slavery was unknown in the age and country of which they speak.
And the contrary is the case. The dawn of Roman history shews us a
people already advanced in civilization to the stage of family and clan
organization, and the tradition allows for the presence of the slave in
the <i>familia</i> from the first. True, he does not appear as the despised
human chattel of later times, but as a man whom misfortune has placed
in bondage. His master is aware that fortune may turn, and that his
bondman is quite capable of resuming his former position if restored
in freedom to his native home. The slave seems to be normally an
Italian<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>, a captive in some war; he may have passed by sale from one
owner to another. But he is not a mere foreign animal, good bad or
indifferent, a doubtful purchase from a roguish dealer. He bears a
name<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> that connects him with his master, <i>Publipor Lucipor Marcipor
Olipor</i> and so on, formed by adding the suffix <i>por</i> to the forename of
Publius Lucius Marcus or Aulus. But, granting that all households
might include a slave or two, and that many so did, also that agriculture
was a common and honourable pursuit,—is it likely that a farming
owner would himself plough or dig and leave his slave<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> to look on?
I conclude therefore that the age was one in which agriculture prevailed
and that the ordinary farmer worked himself and employed slave-labour
side by side with his own so far as his means allowed. All was
on a small scale. Passages of Livy or Dionysius that imply the presence
of great slave-gangs, and desertions on a large scale in time of war are
falsely coloured by ‘anticipation’ of phenomena well known from the
experience of more recent times. But, on however small a scale, slavery
was there. Until there came an impulse of an ‘industrial’ kind,
prompting men to engage in wholesale production for a large market,
the slave remained essentially a domestic, bearing a considerable share
of the family labours, whatever the nature of those labours might be.</p>

<p>As there is no difficulty in believing that Cincinnatus and others of
his type in the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> worked with slaves beside them, so it
is evident that Curius and Fabricius in the first half of the third century
are meant to illustrate the same frugal life and solid patriotism. In
both cases the story lays particular stress on the hero’s incorruptibility
and cheerful endurance of poverty. A well-known scene<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> represents
Curius at his rustic villa eating a dinner of herbs and refusing a gift of
gold from Samnite ambassadors. He is an honest farmer-citizen of the
good old sort. Fabricius is another, famed especially for his calm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
defiance of the threats and cajolery of Pyrrhus, and impervious to
bribes. Both these traditions received much legendary colouring in
course of time. The passage bearing most directly on my present inquiry
is a fragment<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> of Dionysius, in which Fabricius is spurning the
offers of king Pyrrhus, who is very anxious to secure the good man’s
services as his chief minister on liberal terms. He says ‘nor need I tell
you of my poverty, that I have but a very small plot of land with
a mean cottage, and that I get my living neither from money at
interest (ἀπὸ δανεισμάτων) nor from slaves (ἀπ’ ἀνδραπόδων).’ Below
he declares that living under Roman conditions he holds himself a
happy man, ‘for with industry and thrift I find my poor little farm
sufficient to provide me with necessaries.’ And his constitution (φύσις)
does not constrain him to hanker after unnecessary things. Here we
have a good specimen of the moral stories with which the later
rhetoricians edified their readers. But what does ‘from slaves’ mean?
Is Fabricius denying that he employs slave-labour on his farm? If so,
I confess that I do not believe the denial as being his own genuine
utterance. I take it to be put into his mouth by Dionysius, writing
under the influence of the agricultural conditions of a much later time,
when great slaveowners drew large incomes from the exploitation of
slave-labour on great estates. But I am not sure that Dionysius means
him to be saying more than ‘I am not a big capitalist farming on a
large scale by slave-gangs.’ How far this writer really understood the
state of things in the third century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, is hard to say. In any case he
is repeating what he has picked up from earlier writers and not letting
it suffer in the repetition. Taken by himself, he is no more a sufficient
witness to the practice of Fabricius than to that of Cincinnatus. That
there was slavery is certain: that Fabricius had scruples against employing
slaves is hardly credible.</p>

<p>In the ages during which Rome gradually won her way to the
headship of Italy the Roman citizen was normally both farmer and
soldier: the soldier generally a man called up from his farm for a campaign,
the farmer of military age always potentially a soldier. This
state of things was evidently not peculiar to Rome. What makes it
striking in the case of Rome is the well-considered system by which
the military machine was kept in working order. The development of
fortress colonies and extension of roads gave to Roman farmers in the
border-lands more security than any neighbouring power could give to
its own citizens on its own side of the border. Mobilization was more
prompt and effective on the Roman side under a central control: the
fortresses served as a hindrance to hostile invaders, as refuges to the
rustics at need, and as bases for Roman armies. It is no great stretch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
of imagination to see in this organization a reason for the prosperity
of Roman agriculture. Farms were no doubt laid waste on both sides
of the border, but the balance of the account was in the long run
favourable to Rome. Among the numerous legends that gathered
round the name of king Pyrrhus is a story<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> that in reply to some discontent
on the part of his Italian allies, to whom his strategy seemed
over-cautious, he said ‘the mere look of the country shews me the
great difference between you and the Romans. In the parts subject to
them are all manner of fruit-trees and vineyards: the land is cultivated
and the farm-establishments are costly: but the estates of my friends
are so laid waste that all signs of human occupation have disappeared.’
The saying may be not authentic or merely overdrawn in rhetorical
transmission. But it probably contains the outlines of a true picture
of the facts. It was the power of giving to her farmer-settlers a more
effective protection than her rivals could give to their own farmers that
enabled Rome to advance steadily and continuously. The organization
was simple enough: the sword was ready to guard the plough, and
the plough to occupy and hold the conquests of the sword.</p>

<p>From the time of the first Punic war we have a remarkable story
relating to M Atilius Regulus, the man around whose name so much
patriotic legend gathered. He appears as one of the good old farmer-heroes.
His farm<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> of seven <i>iugera</i> lay in an unhealthy part of the
country, and the soil was poor. His advice to agriculturists, not to buy
good land in an unhealthy district nor bad land in a healthy one, was
handed down as the opinion of a qualified judge. We are told<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> that
after his victory in Africa he desired to be relieved and return home;
but the Senate did not send out another commander, and so he had to
stay on. He wrote and complained of his detention. Among other
reasons he urged in particular his domestic anxiety. In the epitome
of Livy <span class="allsmcap">XVIII</span> this appears as ‘that his little farm had been abandoned
by the hired men.’ In Valerius Maximus<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> we find a fuller account, thus
‘that the steward in charge of his little farm (seven <i>iugera</i> in the <i>Pupinia</i>)
had died, and the hired man (<i>mercennarium</i>) had taken the
opportunity to decamp, taking with him the farm-stock: therefore he
asked them to relieve him of his command, for he feared his wife and
children would have nothing to live on now the farm was abandoned.’
On hearing this, the Senate ordered that provision should at once be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
made at the cost of the state (<i>a</i>) for cultivation of his farm<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> by contract
(<i>b</i>) for maintenance of his wife and children (<i>c</i>) for making good the
losses he had suffered. The reference of Pliny<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> rather confirms the
details of Valerius, who by himself is not a very satisfactory witness.
Livy is probably the source of all these versions. They are part of the
Roman tradition of the first Punic war. Polybius, whose narrative is
from another line of tradition, says not a word of this story. Indeed,
he declares<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> that Regulus, so far from wishing to be relieved, wanted
to stay on, fearing that he might hand over the credit of a final victory
to a successor. The two traditions cannot be reconciled as they stand.
Probably neither is complete. If we suppose the account of Polybius
to be true, it does not follow as a matter of course that the other story
is a baseless fiction. In any case, the relation of Regulus to the agriculture
of his day, as represented by the story, seemed credible to
Romans of a later age, and deserves serious consideration.</p>

<p>We are told that in the middle of the third century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> a man of
such position and recognized merit that he was specially chosen to fill
the place of a deceased consul in the course of a great war was a farmer
on an estate of seven <i>iugera</i>, from which he was supporting his wife
and family. In his absence on public duty he had left the farm in charge
of a <i>vilicus</i>. The only reference to the labour employed there speaks
of hired men (wage-earners, <i>mercennarii</i>). It does not say that there
were no slaves. But the natural inference is that the <i>vilicus</i> had the
control of a staff consisting wholly or largely of free labourers. Now
that a slave <i>vilicus</i> might in the ordinary run of business be left in
control of labourers, slave or free, seems clear from directions given by
Cato<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> in the next century. The <i>vilicus</i> in this story was therefore
probably a slave, as they were generally if not always. His death left
the hired men uncontrolled, and they took the opportunity of robbing
their employer. Roused by the absent consul’s complaints (whether
accompanied by a request for relief or not), the Senate took up the
matter and arranged to secure him against loss. We do not hear of the
punishment of the dishonest hirelings, or even of a search for them.
This may be merely an omitted detail: at any rate they had probably
left the neighbourhood. The curious thing is that we hear nothing of
the wife of Regulus: that a Roman matron submitted tamely to such
treatment is hard to believe. Was it she who made the complaints and
set the Senate in motion? The general outcome of the story is a conclusion
that hired labour was freely employed in this age, not to
exclusion of slave labour, but combined with it: that is, that the wage-earning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
work of landless men, such as appears in the earlier traditions,
still went on. It was not yet overlaid by the plantation-system, and
degraded by the associations of the slave-gang and the <i>ergastulum</i>.</p>

<p>When we pass on to the second Punic war, of which we have a
fuller and less legendary record, we find the circumstances somewhat
changed, but the importance of the Roman farmer’s grip of the land is
recognized as clearly as before. It is not unlikely that since the time
of the Pyrrhic war the practise of large-scale farming with slave-labour
had begun to appear<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> in Italy, but it can hardly as yet have been
widespread. Large or small, the farms in a large part of the country
had suffered from the ravages of Hannibal, and it would be the land
of Romans and their faithful allies that suffered most. Many rustics
had to seek shelter in walled towns, above all in Rome, and their
presence was no doubt in many ways embarrassing. Naturally, as the
failure of Hannibal became manifest, the Roman Senate was desirous
of restoring these refugees to the land and relieving the pressure on
the city. Livy, drawing no doubt from an earlier annalist, tells us<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> that
in 206 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> the Senate instructed the consuls, before they left for the seat
of war, to undertake the bringing back of the common folk (<i>plebis</i>) on
to the land. They pointed out that this was desirable, and possible
under the better conditions now prevailing. ‘But it was for the people
(<i>populo</i>) not at all an easy matter; for the free farmers (<i>cultoribus</i>) had
perished in the war, there was a shortage of slaves (<i>inopia servitiorum</i>),
the live stock had been carried off, and the farmsteads (<i>villis</i>) wrecked
or burnt. Yet under pressure from the consuls a good many did go
back to the land.’ He adds that what had raised the question at this
particular juncture was the appeal of a deputation from Placentia and
Cremona. These two Latin colonies, founded twelve years before as
fortresses to hold the region of the Po, had suffered from Gaulish raids
and had no longer a sufficient population, many settlers having gone
off elsewhere. The Roman commander in the district was charged to
provide for their protection, and the truant colonists ordered to return
to their posts. It was evidently thought that with full numbers and
military support there would be an end to the derelict condition of
their territories, and that the two colonies would soon revive.</p>

<p>This attempt to reestablish the rustic population lays stress upon
the general identity of farmer and soldier and the disturbance of
agriculture by the ravages of war. But most notable is the mention
of the shortage of slave-labour as a hindrance to resumption of work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
on derelict farms. It has been held<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> that this clause refers only to
large estates worked by slave-gangs, while the free farmers stand for
the men on small holdings, who presumably employed no slaves.
Now it is quite conceivable that this contrast may have been in Livy’s
mind as he wrote in the days of Augustus. That it was the meaning
of the older author from whom he took the facts is not an equally
probable inference. No doubt lack of slaves would hinder or prevent
the renewal of tillage on a big estate. But what of a small farm whose
owner had fallen in the war? The absence of the father in the army
would be a most serious blow to the efficient working of the farm. If
the raids of the enemy drove his family to take refuge in Rome, and
the farm was let down to weeds, more labour than ever would be
needed to renew cultivation. When there was no longer any hope of
his return, the supply of sufficient labour was the only chance of reviving
the farm. Surely there must have been many cases in which
the help of one or two slaves was the obvious means of supplying it.
Therefore, if we recognize that slave-labour had long been a common
institution in Roman households, we shall not venture to assert that
only large estates are referred to. That such estates, worked by slave-gangs,
were numerous in 206 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, is not likely: that small farmers often
(not always) eked out their own labour with the help of a slave, is far
more so. The actual shortage of slaves<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> had been partly brought about
by the employment of many in military service. Some had no doubt
simply run away. And the period of great foreign conquests and a
full slave-market had yet to come.</p>

<p>I do not venture to dispute that the accumulation of capital in the
form of ready money available for speculation in state leases, farming
of revenues, and other contracts, had already begun at Rome in the
age of the great Punic wars. In the second war, contracts for the
supply of necessaries to the armed forces played a considerable part,
and we hear of contractors<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> who practised shameless frauds on the
state. Greed was a plant that throve in the soil of Roman life: the
scandals of the later Republic were merely the sinister developments
of an old tendency favoured by opportunities. Land-grabbing in particular
was, if consistent tradition may be believed, from early times
a passion of Roman nobles: and the effect of a law<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> forbidding them
to become ship-owners and engage in commerce was to concentrate
their enterprise on the acquisition of great landed estates. Another
notable fact is the large voluntary loans<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> which the government was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
able to raise in the critical period of the great war. In the year 210,
when the financial strain was extreme, a very large contribution of the
kind took place. In 204 the Senate arranged a scheme<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> for repayment
in three instalments. In 200 the lenders, apparently alarmed by
the delay in paying the second instalment, became clamorous. The
Punic war was at an end, and war with Philip of Macedon just declared:
they wanted to get their money back. We are told<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> that the
state was not able to find the cash, and that the cry of many creditors
was ‘there are plenty of farms for sale, and we want to buy.’ The
Senate devised a middle way of satisfying them. They were to be
offered the chance of acquiring the state domain-land within fifty
miles of Rome at a valuation fixed by the consuls. This seems to
mean, up to the amount of the instalment then in question. But they
were not thereby to receive the land in full private<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> property. A quit-rent
of one <i>as</i> was to be set on each <i>iugerum</i>, in evidence that the
property still belonged to the state. Thus, when the state finances
should admit, they might get back their ready money if they preferred
it and give back the land to the state. The offer was gladly accepted,
and the land taken over on these terms was called ‘third-part land’
(<i>trientabulum</i>) as representing ⅓ of the money lent. The final instalment
appears to have been paid in cash<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> in the year 196.</p>

<p>That these patriotic creditors were men with a keen eye for a
bargain, and that they made a good one in the above arrangement, is
pretty clear. This is the only occasion on which we hear of the <i>trientabula</i>
plan of settling a money claim by what was in effect a perpetual
lease at a nominal rent terminable by reconversion into a money claim
at the pleasure of the lessee. No doubt the valuation was so made as
to give the creditor a good margin of security over and above the sum
secured. There was therefore no temptation to call for the cash and
surrender the land. From the reference<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> to <i>trientabula</i> in the agrarian
law of 111 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> it would seem that some at least of these beneficial
tenancies were still in existence after the lapse of nearly 90 years.
They would pass by inheritance or sale as the ordinary <i>possessiones</i> of
state domains did, and eventually become merged in the private properties
that were the final result of the land-legislation of the revolutionary
age. For the capitalists, already powerful in 200 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, became
more and more powerful as time went on. And this use of public land
to discharge public debts was undoubtedly a step tending to promote
the formation of the great estates (<i>latifundia</i>) which were the ruin of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
the wholesome old land-system in a great part of Italy. With this
tendency the wholesale employment of slave-labour went hand in hand.</p>

<p>But we must not forget that the creditors in 200 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> are made to
press for their money on the ground that they wanted to invest it in
land, of which there was plenty then in the market. This may be a
detail added by Livy himself: but surely it is more likely that he is
repeating what he found in his authorities. In any case the land referred
to can hardly be other than the derelict farms belonging to those
who had suffered by the war. In earlier times we have traditions of
men losing their lands through inability to pay the debts for which
they stood pledged. In a somewhat later time we hear<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> of small
farmers being bought out cheaply by neighbouring big landlords, and
bullied if they made difficulty about leaving their farms. The present
case is different, arising directly out of the war. The father of a family
might be dead, or disinclined to go back to monotonous toil after the
excitements of military life, or unable to find the extra labour for
reclaiming a wasted and weed-grown farm, or means of restocking it.
He or his heir would probably not have capital to tide him over the
interval before the farm was again fully productive: his immediate
need was probably ready money. No wonder that farms were in the
market, and at prices that made a land-grabber’s mouth water. The
great war certainly marked a stage in the decay of the small-farm
agriculture, the healthy condition of which had hitherto been the
soundest element of Roman strength.</p>

<p>Before we leave the traditions of the early period it is necessary
to refer to the question of free wage-earning labour. Have we any
reason to think that under the conditions of early Rome there was
any considerable class of rustic<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> wage-earners? Nearly all the passages
that suggest an affirmative answer are found in the work of Dionysius,
who repeatedly uses<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> the Greek word θητεύειν of this class of labour.
It is represented as being practically servile, for it meant working with
slaves or at least doing the work which according to the writer<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> was
(even in the regal period) done by slaves. The poor Plebeians appear
as loathing such service: their desire is for plots of land on which each
man can work freely for himself. This desire their protectors, kings
or tribunes, endeavour to gratify by allotments as occasion serves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Now that there was land-hunger from the earliest times, and that
agriculture was in itself an honourable trade, we have no good reason
for doubting. But that the dislike of wage-earning labour as such was
the main motive of land-hunger is a more doubtful proposition. It
may be true, but it sounds very like an explanation supplied by a
learned but rhetorical historian. We know that Dionysius regarded
Rome as a city of Greek origin. The legends of early Attica were
doubtless familiar to him. We may grant that there was probably
some likeness between the labour-conditions of early Rome and early
Athens. But historians are ever tempted to detect analogies in haste
and remodel tradition at leisure. I suspect that the two features of
the same picture, the prevalence of rustic slavery and also of rustic
wage-earning, are taken from different lines of tradition, and both
overdrawn.</p>

<p>In connexion with this question it is necessary to turn back to a
remarkable passage<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> of Livy referring to the year 362 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. The famous
L Manlius the martinet (<i>imperiosus</i>) was threatened with a public
prosecution by a tribune for misuse of his powers as dictator in the
year just past. To create prejudice against the accused, the prosecutor
further alleged that he had treated his son Titus with cruel severity.
The young man was slow of wit and speech, but no wrongdoing had
been brought home to him. Yet his father had turned him out of his
city home, had cut him off from public life and the company of other
youths, and put him to servile work, shutting him up in what was
almost a slaves’ prison (<i>ergastulum</i>). The daily affliction of such a life
was calculated to teach the dictator’s son that he had indeed a martinet
for his father. To keep his son among the flocks in the rustic condition
and habit of a country boor was to intensify any natural defects of
his own offspring, conduct too heartless for even the brute beasts. But
the young Manlius upset all calculations. On hearing what was in contemplation
he started for Rome with a knife, made his way into the
tribune’s presence in the morning and made him solemnly swear to
drop the prosecution by a threat of killing him then and there if he
did not take the oath. The tribune swore, and the trial fell through.
The Roman commons were vexed to lose the chance of using their
votes to punish the father for his arbitrary and unfeeling conduct, but
they approved the dutiful act of the son, and took the first opportunity
of electing him a military officer. This young man was afterwards the
renowned T Manlius Torquatus, who followed his father’s example of
severity by putting to death his own son for a breach of military discipline.</p>

<p>The story is a fine specimen of the edifying legends kept in circulation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
by the Romans of later days. That the greatness of Rome was
above all things due to their grim old fathers who endured hardness
and sacrificed all tender affections to public duty, was the general moral
of these popular tales. Exaggeration grew with repetition, and details
became less and less authentic. In particular the circumstances of their
own time were foisted in by narrators whose imagination did not suffice
to grasp the difference of conditions in the past. In the above story
we have a reference to <i>ergastula</i>, the barracoons in which the slave-gangs
on great estates were confined when not actually at work. Now
the system of which these private prisons were a marked feature certainly
belongs to a later period, when agriculture on a large scale was
widely practised, not to make a living for a man and his family, but to
make a great income for a single individual by the labour of many.
Here then we have a detail clearly not authentic, which throws doubt
on the whole setting of the story. Again, we have agricultural labour
put before us as degrading (<i>opus servile</i>). It is a punishment, banishing
a young Roman from his proper surrounding in the life of Rome, and
dooming him to grow up a mere clodhopper. There may have been
some points in the original story of which this is an exaggerated version:
for it is evident that from quite early days of the Republic men of the
ruling class found it necessary to spend much time in or quite close to
the city. But the representation of agriculture as a servile occupation
is grossly inconsistent with the other legends glorifying the farmer-heroes
of yore. It is of course quite impossible to prove that no isolated
cases of a young Roman’s banishment to farm life ever occurred. But
that such a proceeding was so far ordinary as fairly to be reckoned
typical, is in the highest degree improbable. That later writers should
invent or accept such colouring for their picture, is no wonder. In the
Attic New Comedy, with which Roman society was familiarized<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> in the
second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, this situation was found. The later conditions of
Roman life, in city and country, tended to make the view of agriculture
as a servile trade, capable of being rendered penal, more and more intelligible
to Romans. Accordingly we find this view cynically accepted<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
by Sallust, and warmly protested against<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> by Cicero. In order to
weaken the case of his client Sextus Roscius, it was urged that the
young man’s father distrusted him and sent him to live the life of a
boor on his farm in Umbria. Cicero, evidently anxious as to the possible
effect of this construction of facts on the coming verdict, was at great
pains to counter it by maintaining that the father’s decision was in truth
a compliment: in looking for an honest and capable manager of his
rustic estate he had found the right man in this son. The orator surely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
did not enlarge on this point for nothing. And it is to be noted that
in insisting on the respectability of a farmer’s life he sees fit to refer
to the farmer-consuls of the olden time. He feels, no doubt, that unsupported
assertions<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> as to the employment of sons in agriculture by
his contemporaries were not likely to carry much weight with the jury.</p>

<p>After the above considerations I come to the conclusion that Livy’s
representation of agriculture as a servile occupation in the case of
Manlius is a coloured utterance of no historical value. A minute consistency
is not to be looked for in the writings of an author to whom
picturesqueness of detail appeals differently at different moments. For
Livy was in truth deeply conscious of the sad changes in Italian
country life brought about by the transition to large-scale agriculture.
Under the year 385 he is driven to moralize<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> on the constant renewal
of Volscian and Aequian wars. How ever did these two small peoples
find armies for the long-continued struggle? He suggests possible
answers to the question, the most significant of which is that in those
days there was a dense free population in those districts,—districts
which in his own time, he says, would be deserted but for the presence
of Roman slaves. To describe vividly the decay of free population, he
adds that only a poor little nursery of soldiers is left (<i>vix seminario
exiguo militum relicto</i>) in those parts. The momentous results of the
change of system are not more clearly grasped by Lucan or Pliny
himself. Livy then is not to be cited as a witness to the existence of
great numbers of rustic slaves in Italy before the second Punic war,
nor even then for the highly-organized gang-system by which an industrial
character was given to agriculture.</p>

<p>One more story, and a strange one, needs to be considered, for it
bears directly on the labour-question. The time in which it is placed
is the latter part of the period of the Roman conquest of Italy. In a
fragment<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> of one of his later books Dionysius tells us of the arbitrary
doings of a consul Postumius, a Patrician of high rank who had already
been twice consul. After much bullying he made his colleague, a
Plebeian of recent nobility, resign to him the command in the Samnite
war. This was an unpopular act, but he went on to worse. From his
army he drafted some 2000 men on to his own estate, and set them to
cut away brushwood without providing cutting tools (ἄνευ σιδήρου).
And he kept them there a long time doing the work of wage-earners
or slaves (θητῶν ἔργα καὶ θεραπόντων ὑπηρετοῦντας). Into the tale of
his further acts of arbitrary insolence we need not enter here, nor into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the public prosecution and condemnation to a heavy fine that awaited
him at the end of his term of office. Suffice it that the story is in
general confirmed<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> by Livy, and that the hero of it seems to have been
remembered in Roman tradition as a classic instance of self-willed
audacity and disregard of the conventions that were the soul of Roman
public life. So far as the labour is concerned, it seems to me that what
was objected to in the consul’s conduct was the use of his military
supreme power (<i>imperium</i>) for his own private profit. He treated a
fatigue-party as a farm labour-gang. Freemen might work on their
own land side by side with their slaves: they might work for wages
on another man’s land side by side with his slaves. Any objection they
might feel would be due to the unwelcome pressure of economic
necessity. But to be called out for military service (and in most cases
from their own farms), and then set to farm-labour on another man’s
land under military discipline, was too much. We must bear in mind
that a Roman army of the early Republic was not composed of pauper
adventurers who preferred a life of danger with hopes of loot and licence
to hard monotonous toil. The very poor were not called out, and the
ranks were filled with citizens who had at least some property to lose.
Therefore it might easily happen that a soldier set to rough manual
labour by Postumius had to do for him the service that was being done
at home for himself by a wage-earner or a slave. He was a soldier
because he was a free citizen; he was being employed in place of a
slave because he was a soldier under martial law. In no free republic
could such a wrong be tolerated. The words of the epitome of Livy
state the case with sufficient precision. <i>L Postumius consularis, quoniam
cum exercitui praeesset opera militum in agro suo usus erat, damnatus
est.</i> It is remarkable that, among the other epitomators and collectors
of anecdotes who drew from the store of Livy, not one, not even Valerius
Maximus, records this story. To Livy it must have seemed important,
or he would not have laid enough stress on it to attract the attention
of the writer of the epitome. So too the detailed version of Dionysius,
probably drawn from the same authority as that of Livy, struck the
fancy of a maker of extracts and caused his text to be preserved to us.
It surely descends, like many other of the old stories, in a line of
Plebeian tradition, and is recorded as an illustration of the survival of
Patrician insolence in a headstrong consul after the two Orders had
been politically equalized by the Licinian laws.</p>

<p>Beside these fragments of evidence there are in the later Roman
literature many passages in which writers directly assert that their
forefathers lived a life of simple frugality and worked with their own
hands on their own little farms. But as evidence the value of such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
passages is not very great. They testify to a tradition: but in most
cases the tradition is being used for the purposes of moralizing rhetoric.
Now the glorification of ‘good old times’ has in all ages tempted authors
to aim rather at striking contrast between past and present than at
verification of their pictures of the past. To impute this defect to satirists
is a mere commonplace. But those who are not professed satirists are
often exposed to the same influence in a less degree. The most striking
phenomenon in this kind is the chorus of poets in the Augustan age.
The Emperor, aware that the character of Reformer is never a very
popular one, preferred to pose as Restorer. The hint was given, and
the literary world acted on it. Henceforth the praises of the noble and
efficient simplicity of the ancients formed a staple material of Roman
literature.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXI">XXI. ABSTRACT OF CONCLUSIONS.</h3>

<p>In reference to the early period down to 201 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> I think we are
justified in coming to the following conclusions.</p>

<p>1. The evidence, consisting of fragmentary tradition somewhat
distorted and in some points exaggerated by the influence of moral
purpose on later writers, is on the whole consistent and credible.</p>

<p>2. From it we get a picture of agriculture as an honourable trade,
the chief occupation of free citizens, who are in general accustomed
to work with their own hands.</p>

<p>3. The Roman citizen as a rule has an allotment of land as his
own, and an early classification of citizens (the ‘Servian Constitution’)
was originally based on landholding, carrying with it the obligation
to military service.</p>

<p>4. The Roman family had a place for the slave, and the slave, a
domestic helper, normally an Italian, was not as yet the despised
alien chattel of whom we read in a later age.</p>

<p>5. As a domestic he bore a part in all the labours of the family, and
therefore as a matter of course in the commonest of all, agriculture.</p>

<p>6. In this there was nothing degrading. Suggestions to that effect
are the echoes of later conditions.</p>

<p>7. Under such relations of master and slave it was quite natural
that manumission should (as it did) operate to make the slave not
only free but a citizen. That this rule led to very troublesome results
in a later period was owing to change of circumstances.</p>

<p>8. Slavery then was, from the earliest times of which we have
any tradition, an integral part of the social and economic system, as
much in Italy as in Greece. It was there, and only needed the stimulus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of prospective economic gain for capitalists to organize it on a crudely
industrial basis, without regard to considerations of humanity or the
general wellbeing of the state.</p>

<p>9. Of wage-earning labour on the part of freemen we have little
trace in tradition. The reported complaints of day-labour performed
for Patrician nobles in early times are probably not unconnected
with the institution of clientship, and in any case highly coloured by
rhetoric.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROMEMIDDLE_PERIOD">ROME—MIDDLE PERIOD</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXII">XXII. INTRODUCTORY GENERAL VIEW.</h3>

<p>The overthrow of Carthage put an end to a period of terrible
anxiety to the Roman government, and the first feeling was naturally
one of relief. But the sufferings of the war-weary masses had produced
an intense longing for peace and rest. It might be true that a
Macedonian war was necessary in the interest of the state: but it
was only with great difficulty that the Senate overcame opposition to
a forward policy. For the sufferings of the people, more particularly
the farmers, were not at an end. The war indemnities from Carthage
might refill the empty treasury, and enable the state to discharge its
public obligations to contractors and other creditors. So far well:
but receipts of this kind did little or nothing towards meeting the
one vital need, the reestablishment of displaced peasants on the land.
The most accessible districts, generally the best suited for tillage, had
no doubt suffered most in the disturbances of war; and the future
destinies of Rome and Italy were depending on the form that revival
of agriculture would take. The race of small farmers had been
hitherto the backbone of Roman power. But the wars of the last
two generations had brought Rome into contact with an agricultural
system of a very different character. Punic agriculture<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> was industrial:
that is, conducted for profit on a large scale and directed by purely
economic considerations. Cheap production was the first thing. As
the modern large farmer relies on machinery, so his ancient predecessor
relied on domesticated animals; chiefly on the animal with hands, the
human slave.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind that during the second Punic war the
Roman practice of employing contractors for all manner of state
services (<i>publica</i>) had been greatly developed. Companies of <i>publicani</i>
had played an active part and had thriven on their enterprises. These
companies were probably already, as they certainly were in later
times, great employers of slaves. In any case they represented a
purely industrial and commercial view of life, the ‘economic’ as
opposed to the ‘national’ set of principles. Their numbers were
beyond all doubt greater than they had ever been before. With such
men the future interests of the state would easily be obscured by
immediate private interests, selfish appetite being whetted by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
recent taste of profits. If a large section of the farmer class seemed
in danger of extinction through the absorption of their farms in
great estates, legislation to prevent it was not likely to have the warm
support of these capitalists. That financial interests were immensely
powerful in the later Roman Republic is universally admitted, but I
do not think sufficient allowance is made for their influence in the
time of exhaustion at the very beginning of the second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>.
The story of the <i>trientabula</i>, discussed above, is alone enough to shew
how this influence was at work; and it was surely no isolated phenomenon.
We have therefore reason to believe that many of the
farmers dispossessed by the war never returned to their former homes,
and we naturally ask what became of them. Some no doubt were
unsettled and unfitted for the monotonous toil of rustic life by the
habits contracted in campaigning. Such men would find urban idleness,
or further military service with loot in prospect, more to their
taste: some of these would try both experiences in turn. We trace
their presence in the growth of a city mob, and in the enlistment of
veterans to give tone and steadiness to somewhat lukewarm armies in
new wars. But it is not to be assumed that this element constituted
the whole, or even the greater part, of those who did not go back to
their old farms. The years 200-180 saw the foundation of 19 new
<i>coloniae</i>, and it is reasonable to suppose that the <i>coloni</i> included a
number of the men unsettled by the great war. The group founded
in 194-2 were designed to secure the coast of southern Italy against
attack by an Eastern power controlling large fleets. Those of 189-1
were in the North, the main object being to strengthen the Roman
grip of Cisalpine Gaul. But already in 198-5 it had been found
necessary to support the colonies on the Po (Placentia and Cremona)
against attacks of the Gauls, and in 190 they were reinforced with
contingents of fresh colonists. For the firm occupation of northern
Italy was a policy steadily kept in view, and only interrupted for a
time by the strain of Eastern wars.</p>

<p>In trying to form a notion of the condition of agriculture in the
second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, and particularly of the labour question, we must
never lose sight of the fact that military service was still obligatory<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
on the Roman citizen, and that this was a period of many wars. The
farmer-soldier, liable to be called up at any time until his forty-sixth
year, might have to break off important work which could not without
risk of loss be left in other hands. At the worst, a sudden call might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
mean ruin. Pauper wage-earners, landless men, were not reached by
the military levy in the ordinary way. How soon they began to be
enrolled as volunteers, and to what extent, is uncertain. But conscription
of qualified citizens remained the staple method of filling
the legions<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> until the famous levy held by Marius in 107. Conscription
had for a long time been becoming more and more unpopular
and difficult to enforce, save in cases where easy victory and abundant
booty were looked for. The Roman government fell into the habit of
employing chiefly the contingents of the Italian Allies in hard and
unremunerative campaigns. This unfair treatment, and other wrongs
to match, led to the great rebellion of 90 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. But the grant of the
Roman franchise to the Italians, extorted by force of arms, though it
made more Roman citizens, could not make more Roman farmers.
The truth is, a specializing process was going on. The soldier was
becoming more and more a professional: farming was becoming more
and more the organized exploitation of labour. Long and distant
wars unfitted the discharged soldiers for the monotonous round of
rustic life: while they kept the slave-market well supplied with
captives, thus making it easy for capitalists to take advantage of great
areas of land cheaply acquired from time to time. Moreover, the
advance of Roman dominion had another effect beside the mere
supply of labouring hands. It made Rome the centre of the Mediterranean
world, the place where all important issues were decided,
and where it was necessary to reside. The wealthy landowner was
practically compelled to spend most of his time in the ruling city, in
close touch with public affairs. Now this compelled him to manage
his estates by stewards, keeping an eye on them so far as his engagements
in Rome left him free to do so. And this situation created a
demand for highly-qualified stewards. The supply of these had to
come mainly from the eastern countries of old civilization. But if
technical skill could thus be procured (and it was very necessary for
the variety of crops that were taking the place of corn), it was
generally accompanied by an oriental subtlety the devices of which
were not easy to penetrate. From the warnings of the agricultural
writers, as to the need of keeping a strict watch on a <i>vilicus</i>, we may
fairly infer that these favoured slaves were given to robbing their
masters. The master, even if he had the knowledge requisite for
practical control, seldom had the leisure for frequent visits to his
estate. What he wanted was a regular income to spend: and the
astute steward who was always ready with the expected cash on the
appointed day had little fear of reprimand or punishment. His own
interest was that his own master should expect as little as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and it is obvious that this would not encourage a sincere effort to get
the most out of the estate in a favourable year. His master’s expectations
would then rise, and the disappointment of poor returns in a bad
year might have serious consequences for himself.</p>

<p>These considerations may help us to understand why the history
of the later Roman Republic gives so gloomy a picture of agriculture.</p>

<p>We find the small farmer, citizen and soldier too, dying out as a class
in a great part of Italy. We find the land passing into the hands of
a few large owners whose personal importance was vastly increased
thereby. Whether bought cheap on a glutted market or ‘possessed’
in a sort of copyhold tenancy from the state, whether arable or
pasture, it is at all events clear that the bulk of these <i>latifundia</i> (if
not the whole) had been got on very easy terms. The new holders
were not hampered by lack of capital or labour, as may often have
been the case with the old peasantry. Slave-labour was generally
cheap, at times very cheap. Knowledge and skill could be bought, as
well as bone and muscle. Like the ox and the ass, the slave was only
fed and clothed and housed sufficiently to keep him fit for work: his
upkeep while at work was not the canker eating up profits. With
the influx of wealth, the spoils of conquest, the tribute of subject
provinces, the profits of blackmail and usury, prices of almost everything
were rising in the second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. Corn, imported and sold
cheap to the Roman poor, was an exception: but the Italian landlords
were ceasing to grow corn, save for local consumption. Some
authorities, if not all, thought<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> that grazing paid better than tillage:
and it was notorious that pasturage was increasing and cultivation
declining. The slave-herdsmen, hardy and armed against wolves and
brigands, were a formidable class. When combined with mutinous
gladiators they were, as Spartacus shewed in 73-1 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, wellnigh irresistible
save by regular armies in formal campaigns. The owner of a
vast estate, controlling huge numbers of able-bodied ruffians who
had nothing to lose themselves and no inducement to spare others,
was in fact a public danger if driven to desperation. He could
mobilize an army of robbers and cutthroats at a few days notice, live
on the country, and draw recruits from all the slave-gangs near. It
was not want of power that crippled the representatives of large-scale
agriculture.</p>

<p>And yet in the last days of the Republic, when the fabric of the
state was cracking under repeated strains, we are told that, among
the various types of men led by financial embarrassments to favour
revolutionary schemes, one well-marked group consisted of great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
landlords. These men, says<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Cicero, though deep in debt, could quite
well pay what they owe by selling their lands. But they will not do
this: they are ‘land-proud.’ The income from their estates will not
cover the interest on their debts, but they go on foolishly trying to
make it do so. In this struggle they are bound to be beaten. In other
words, the return on their landed estates is not enough to support a
life of extravagance in Rome. So they borrow, at high interest. The
creditors of course take good security, with a margin for risks. So,
in order to keep the social status of a great landlord, the borrower
takes a loan of less than the capital value of his land, while he has
to pay for the accommodation more than the income from the land.
Ruin is the certain end of such finance, and it is only in a revolution
that there is any hope of ‘something turning up’ in favour of the
debtor. We must not suppose that all or most of the great landlords
of the day had reached the stage of embarrassment described by
Cicero. That there were some in that plight, is not to be doubted,
even when we have allowed freely for an orator’s overstatements. But
it is hardly rash to suppose that there were some landlords who were
not in debt, at least to a serious extent, either through good returns
from their lands or from other investments, or even from living
thriftily. What seems quite clear is that large-scale farming of land
was by no means so remunerative financially as other forms of investment;
and that though, as pointed out above, it was carried on with
not a few points in its favour.</p>

<p>In the same descriptive passage<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> the orator refers to another class
of landowners ripe for revolution. These were the veterans of Sulla,
settled by him as <i>coloni</i> on lands of farmers dispossessed on pretext
of complicity with his Marian opponents. Their estates were no
doubt on a smaller scale than those of the class just spoken of above.
But they were evidently comfortable allotments. The discharged
soldiers made bad farmers. They meant to enjoy the wealth suddenly
bestowed, and they had no notion of economy. Their extravagance,
one form of which was the keeping of a number<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> of slaves, soon
landed them hopelessly in debt. So they also saw their only chance
of recovery in a renewal of civil war and fresh confiscations. It was
said that a number of necessitous rustics (probably some of the very
men ejected from the farms) were ready to join them in a campaign
of plunder. Here we have a special picture of the military colonist,
one of the most sinister figures in the last age of the Republic. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
no doubt highly coloured, but the group settled in Etruria were
probably some of the worst specimens. In such hands agriculture
could not flourish, and the true interests of Rome could hardly have
suffered a more deadly blow than the transfer of Italian lands from
those who could farm them to those who could not. It was not merely
that lands were ‘let down.’ Italy was made less able to maintain a
native population, fitted and willing to serve the state in peace and
war. The effects of this diminution of the free rustic population were
most seriously felt under the Empire. Writers of the Augustan age
deplore<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> the disappearance of the old races in a large part of Italy,
displaced by alien slaves; and their cry is repeated by later generations.
The imperial country that had conquered the Mediterranean
world became dependent on subjects and foreigners for her own
defence.</p>

<p>The evil plight of agriculture in Cicero’s day was merely a continuation
and development of the process observable in the second
century. Experience had probably moderated some of the crude and
blundering methods of the land-grabbers whose doings provoked the
agrarian movement of the Gracchi. But in essence the system was
the same. And it was a failure, a confessed evil. Why? It is easy
to reply that slave-labour is wasteful; and this is I believe an economic
truism. But it is well to look a little further. Let me begin by
quoting from an excellent book<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> written at a time when this subject
was one of immediate practical interest. ‘The profitableness which has
been attributed to slavery is profitableness estimated exclusively from
the point of view of the proprietor of slaves.... The profits of
capitalists may be increased by the same process by which the gross
revenue of a country is diminished, and therefore the community as
a whole may be impoverished through the very same means by which
a portion of its number is enriched. The economic success of slavery
therefore is perfectly consistent with the supposition that it is prejudicial
to the material wellbeing of the country where it is established.’
These propositions I do not dispute: I had come to the
same conclusion long before I read this passage. I further admit
that in the case of Rome and Italy the community as a whole was
impoverished by the slave-system: it was the constant influx of
tributes from the provinces that kept up the appearance of wealth at
the centre of empire. But whether, in the case of agriculture, the
capitalist landlords were really enriched by the profits of plantation
slavery, is surely a question open to doubt.</p>

<p>Those of them whose capital sunk in great estates and gangs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
slaves brought in only a moderate return, while they were borrowing
at a higher rate of interest, were certainly not the richer for their landed
investments. To keep up a fictitious show of solid wealth for the
moment, they were marching to ruin. But the man who made his income
from landed estates suffice for his needs,—can we say that he
was enriched thereby? Hardly, if he was missing the chance of more
remunerative investments by having his money locked up in land. He
made a sacrifice, in order to gratify a social pride which had in Roman
public life a certain political value. Under the Republic, this political
value might be realized in the form of provincial or military appointments,
profitable through various species of blackmail. But the connexion
of such profits with ownership of great plantations is too remote
to concern us here. A smart country-place, where influential friends
could be luxuriously entertained, was politically more to the point.
Now if, as seems certain, the great plantations were not always (perhaps
very seldom were) a strictly economic success, though protected against
Transalpine competition<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> in wine and oil, can we discern any defects
in the system steadily operating to produce failure?</p>

<p>When we admit that slave-labour is wasteful, we mean that its
output as compared with that of free labour is not proportionate to the
time spent. Having no hope of bettering his condition, the slave does
only just enough to escape punishment; having no interest in the profits
of the work, he does it carelessly. If, as we know, the free worker paid
by time needs constant watching to keep him up to the mark, much
more is this true of the slave. Hence a system of piece-work is disliked
by the free man and hardly applicable in practice to the case of the
slave. But we are not to forget that the slave, having been bought and
paid for, draws no money wage. The interest on his prime cost is on
the average probably much less than a free man’s wage; but the
master cannot pay him off and be rid of him when the job is done.
The owned labourer is on his owner’s hands so long as that owner owns
him. Against this we must set the very low standard of feeding clothing
housing etc allowed in the case of the slave. Nor must we ignore the
economic advantage of slavery as ensuring a permanent supply of
labour: for the free labourer was (and is) not always to be had when
wanted. These were pretty certainly the considerations that underlay
the organization described by the Roman writers on <i>res rustica</i>; a
regular staff of slaves for everyday work, supplemented by hired labour
at times of pressure or for special jobs. And the growing difficulty of
getting hired help probably furnished the motive for developing the
system of <i>coloni</i>. By letting parcels of an estate to small tenants a
landlord could secure the presence of resident freemen in his neighbourhood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
These in their spare time could be employed as labourers.
At how early a date stipulation for labour in part payment of their
rents placed such tenants on a ‘soccage’ footing is not certain. It has
rightly or not, been detected in Columella. At all events it contained
the germ of predial serfdom.</p>

<p>Now, so long as slave-labour was the permanent and vital element
in agriculture, success or failure depended entirely on the efficiency of
direction and control. Accordingly the regular organization of a great
estate was a complete hierarchy. At the head was the <i>vilicus</i>, having
under him foremen skilled in special branches of farm work and head-shepherds
and the like. Even among the rank and file of the slaves
many had special duties occupying all or part of their time, for it was
an object to fix responsibility. But it is clear that the efficiency of the
whole organization depended on that of the <i>vilicus</i>. And he was a slave,
the chattel of a master who could inflict on him any punishment he
chose. The temptation to rob his master<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> for his own profit was probably
not nearly so strong as we might on first thoughts suppose. If
he had contrived to hoard the fruits of his pilferings in portable cash,
what was he to do with it? He was not free to abscond with it. He
would be well known in the neighbourhood: if any slave could escape
detection as a runaway, it would not be he. And detection meant the
loss of all his privileges as steward, with severe punishment to boot.
His obvious policy was to cling to his stewardship, to induce his master
to let him keep a few beasts of his own (as <i>peculium</i>)<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> on some corner
of the estate, and to wait on events. It might be that he looked forward
to manumission after long service. But I cannot find any authority for
such a supposition, or any concrete instance of a manumitted <i>vilicus</i>.
This inclines me to believe that in practice to such a man manumission
was no boon. He was in most cases a native of some distant country,
where he had long been forgotten. The farm of his lord was the nearest
thing he had to a home. I am driven to suppose that as a rule he kept
his post as long as he could discharge its duties, and then sank into the
position of a quasi-pensioned retainer who could pay for his keep by
watching his successor. Ordinary slaves when worn out may have been
put to light duties about the farm, care of poultry etc, and he might
direct them, so far as the new steward allowed. I am guessing thus
only in reference to average cases. The brutal simplicity of selling off
worn-out slaves for what they would fetch was apparently not unknown,
and is approved<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> by Cato.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>It has been briefly hinted above that the steward’s obvious interest
lay in preventing his master from expecting too much in the way of
returns from the estate. The demand for net income, that is to say the
treatment of agriculture as an investment yielding a steady return year
in and year out, was economically unsound. A landlord in public life
wanted a safe income; interest on good debentures, as we should say.
But to guarantee this some capitalist was needed to take the risks of
business, of course with the prospect of gaining in good years more
than he lost in bad ones. Now the Roman landlord had no such protection.
In a business subject to unavoidable fluctuations he was not only
entitled to the profits but liable to the losses. Imagine him just arrived
from Rome, pledged already to some considerable outlay on shows or
simple bribery, and looking for a cash balance larger than that shewn at
the last audit. Let the steward meet him with a tale of disaster, and conceive
his fury. Situations of this kind must surely have occurred, perhaps
not very seldom: and one of the two men was in the absolute power of
the other. We need not imagine the immediate<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> sequel. Stewards on
estates for miles round would be reminded of their own risks of disgrace
and punishment, and would look to their own security. I suggest that
the habitual practice of these trusted men was to keep the produce of
an estate down to a level at which it could easily be maintained; and,
if possible, to represent it as being even less than it really was. Thus
they removed a danger from themselves. This policy implied an easygoing
management of the staff, but the staff were not likely to resent or
betray it. A master like Cato was perhaps not to be taken in by a device
of the kind: but Catos were rare, and the old man’s advice to look sharply
after your <i>vilicus</i> sounds as if he believed many masters to be habitually
fooled by their plausible stewards. If such was indeed the case, here we
have at once a manifest cause of the decline of agriculture. The restriction
of production would become year by year easier to arrange and
conceal, harder and harder to detect. The employment of freemen<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> as
stewards seems not to have been tried as a remedy; partly perhaps
because they would have insisted on good salaries, partly because they
were free to go,—and, if rogues<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>, not empty-handed.</p>

<p>The cause to which I have pointed is one that could continue
operating from generation to generation, and was likely so to continue
until such time as the free farmer should once more occupy the land.
The loving care that agriculture needs could only return with him. It
was not lack of technical knowledge that did the mischief; Varro’s
treatise is enough to prove that. It was the lack of personal devotion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
in the landlords and motive in the stewards. Principles without practice
failed, as they have failed and will fail. Nor must we lay much stress
on the disturbances of the revolutionary period. Had these, damaging
though they were, been the effective cause of decline, surely the long
peace under the early Empire would have led to a solid revival. But,
though a court poet might sing of revival to please his master, more
serious witnesses tell a different tale. In the middle of the first century
AD we have Lucan Columella and the elder Pliny. If Lucan’s pictures
of the countryside peopled with slave-gangs, and of the decay of free
population, are suspected as rhetorically overdrawn, at least they agree
with the evidence of Livy in the time of Augustus, so far as the parts
near Rome are concerned. Columella<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> gravely deplores the neglect of
agriculture, in particular the delegation of management to slaves. The
landlord and his lady have long abdicated their interest in what was
once a noble pursuit: it is now a degrading one, and their places are
taken by the <i>vilicus</i> and <i>vilica</i>. Yet all he can suggest is a more perfect
organization of the slave-staff, and the letting of outlying farms to
tenants. Pliny tells the same woeful story. And while he vents his
righteous indignation on the <i>latifundia</i> that have ruined Italy, he also
mentions instances of great profits<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> made by cultivators of vines and
olives on estates of quite moderate size. But these successful men were
not of the social aristocracy: they were freedmen or other humble folks
who themselves looked sharply after their own business.</p>

<p>Therefore, when we are told<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>, and rightly, that with establishment
of the Empire the political attraction of Rome was lessened, and that
the interest of wealthy landlords became more strictly economic in
character, we must not be in haste to identify this change with a return
of genuine prosperity. That a sort of labour-crisis followed the restoration
of peace is reasonably inferred from the fact that the kidnapping<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
of freemen, and their incorporation in the slave-gangs of great
estates, was one of the abominations with which the early Principate
had to deal. In a more peaceful world the supply of new slaves fell off,
and the price doubtless rose. It would seem that at the same time free
wage-earners were scarce, as was to be expected after the civil wars.
So the highwayman, probably often a discharged soldier, laid hands
on the unprotected wayfarer. After taking his purse, he made a profit
of his victim’s person by selling him as a slave to some landowner
in need of labourers, who asked no questions. Once in the <i>ergastulum</i>
the man had small chance of regaining his freedom unless and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
until an inspection of these private prisons was undertaken by the
government. Such phenomena are not likely to be the inventions of
sensational writers; for the government, heavily weighted with other
responsibilities, was driven to intervene and put down the scandal.
But to do this was not to supply the necessary labour. That problem
remained, and in the attempt to solve it an important development in
the organization of large estates seems to have taken place. While the
regular labour was as before furnished by the slave-staff, and greater
care taken<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> to avoid losses by sickness, and while even the breeding of
slaves under certain restrictions was found worthy of attention, the
need of extra hands at certain seasons was met by an arrangement for
retaining potential free labourers within easy reach. This was an extension
of the system of tenant <i>coloni</i>. Parcels of the estate were let
to small farmers, whose residence was thereby assured. Columella<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
advises a landlord in dealing with his tenants to be more precise in
exacting from them work (<i>opus</i>) than rent (<i>pensiones</i>), and Weber<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> takes
<i>opus</i> to mean not merely the proper cultivation of their several plots
but a stipulated amount of labour on the lord’s farm. The practice of
exacting labour from debtors<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> in discharge of their debt was not a new
one, and this arrangement seems to be the same in a more systematic
form. By taking care to keep the little farm sufficiently small, and
fixing the rent sufficiently high, the tenant was pretty certain to be
often behind with his rent. In such conditions, even if the tenant did
not encumber himself by further borrowing, it is clear that he was very
liable to sink into a ‘soccage’ tenant, bound to render regular services
without wage. Nominally free, he was practically tied to the soil;
while the landlord, nominally but the owner of the soil, gradually
acquired what was of more value than a money rent,—the ownership
of his tenant’s services. In the growing scarcity of slave labour the
lord had a strong motive for insisting on his rights, and so the free
worker travelled down the road to serfdom.</p>

<p>In reviewing the history of rustic slavery, and its bearing on the
labour-question, from the end of the second Punic war to the time of
Marcus Aurelius, it is not necessary to refer to every indication of the
discontents that were normal in the miserable slave-gangs. A few
actual outbreaks of which we have definite records will serve to illustrate
the sort of sleeping volcano, ever liable to explode, on which
thousands of Italian landlords were sitting. The writers on agriculture
were fully conscious of the peril, and among various precepts designed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
to promote order (and, so far as possible, contentment) none is more
significant than the advice<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> not to have too many slaves of the same
race. Dictated by the desire to make rebellious combinations difficult,
this advice is at least as old as Plato<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> and Aristotle.</p>

<p>So early as 196 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> we hear<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> of a slave-rising in Etruria, put down
with great severity by a military force. In 185 there was a great
rising<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> of slave-herdsmen (<i>pastores</i>) in Apulia, put down by the officer
then commanding the SE district. In about another half-century we
begin the series of slave-wars which troubled the Roman world for
some 60 or 70 years and caused a vast destruction of lives and property.
It was the growth of the plantation system under a weak and distracted
government that made such horrors possible. In 139 we hear of a
rising in Sicily, where the plantation system was in full swing. From
135 there was fierce war<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> in the island, not put down till 131 after
fearful bloodshed. The war of Aristonicus<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> in the new province of
Asia, from 132 to 130, seems to have been essentially a slave-war. In
Sicily the old story<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> was repeated 103-99 with the same phenomena
and results. And in the last age of the Republic, 73 to 71 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, Italy
was devastated by the bands of Spartacus, a joint force of gladiators<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
and rustic slaves. For many months the country was at their mercy,
and their final destruction was brought about more by their own disunion
than by the sword of Roman legions. It is recorded<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> to the
credit of Catiline that he refused to enlist rustic slaves in the armed force
with which he fought and fell at Pistoria, resisting the less scrupulous
advice of his confederates in Rome. During the upheaval of the great
civil wars the slaves enjoyed unusual license. Many took arms:
probably many others escaped from bondage. But the establishment
of the Empire, though the supply of slave labour was not equal to the
demand, did not put an end to slave-risings. For instance, in 24 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>
a former soldier of the Imperial Guard planned an insurrection<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> in the
neighbourhood of Brundisium. By promising freedom to the bold slave-herdsmen
scattered about the Apennine forests he got together what
was evidently a force of considerable strength. The lucky arrival of a
squadron of patrol vessels enabled the local quaestor to break up the
conspiracy before it could make head. But Tiberius did not dally with
so serious a matter: a detachment of troops carried off the ringleader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
and his chief accomplices to Rome. Tacitus remarks that there was in
the city a widespread uneasiness, owing to the enormous growth of
slave-gangs while the freeborn population was declining.</p>

<p>These specimens are enough to illustrate a public danger obvious
<i>a priori</i> and hardly needing illustration. The letter of Tiberius<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> to the
Senate in 22 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> shews how he had brooded over the social and economic
condition of Italy. He saw clearly that the appearance of prosperity
in a country where parks and mansions multiplied, and where tillage
was still giving way to pasturage, was unsound. He knew no doubt
that these signs pointed to the decline of the free rural population as
still in progress. As an experienced general he could hardly ignore
the value of such a free population for recruiting armies to serve the
state, or regard its decline with indifference. He refers to the burden
of imperial responsibilities. Now the system inherited from Augustus
set Italy in a privileged position as the imperial land. Surely Tiberius
cannot have overlooked the corresponding liability of Italy to take a
full share in the defence of the empire. Yet in present circumstances
her supply of vigorous manhood was visibly failing. If the present
tendencies continued to act, the present system would inevitably break
down. But, however much Tiberius was inclined to do justice to the
Provinces, he could not escape his first duty to Italy without a complete
change of system: and for this he was not prepared. Such misgivings
of course could not be expressed in a letter to the Senate; but that an
Emperor, temperamentally prone to worry, did not foresee the coming
debility and degradation of Italy, and fret over the prospect, is to me
quite incredible.</p>

<p>The movement for checking luxury, which drew this letter from
Tiberius, resulted according to Tacitus in a temporary reduction of
extravagance in entertainments. The influence of senators brought in
from country towns or the Provinces helped in promoting a simpler
life. It was example, not legislation, that effected whatever improvement
was made. It was the example of Vespasian that did most to
reform domestic economy. But the historian was well aware that reforms
depending on the lead of individuals are transient. We have no
reason to believe that any lasting improvement of agriculture was
produced by these fitful efforts. From stray references in Tacitus,
from the letters of the younger Pliny, from notices in Juvenal and
Martial, it is evident that in the great plain of the Cisalpine and in
the Italian hill country farming of one kind or another went on and
prospered. In such districts a real country life might be found. But
this was no new development: it had never ceased. Two conditions
were necessary, remoteness from Rome and difficulty of access, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
often coincided. Estates near the city (<i>suburbana</i>) were mostly, if not
in all cases, held as resorts for rest or pleasure. If a steward could
grow a fair supply of farm-produce, so much the better: but the duty
of having all ready for visits of the master and his friends was the
first charge on his time and attention. Even at some considerable
distance from the city the same condition prevailed, if an estate lay
near a main road and thus could be reached without inconvenient
exertion.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">XXIII. CATO.</h3>

<p>The book <i>de agri cultura</i><a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> of <b>M Porcius Cato</b> (234-149 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) is a
remarkable work by a remarkable man. It is generally agreed that it
represents his views, though the form in which it has come down to us
has led to differences of opinion as to the degree in which the language
has been modified in transmission. We need only consider some of the
contemporary facts and movements with which Cato was brought into
contact and which affected his mental attitude as a public man. He
took part in the second Punic war, and died just as the third war was
beginning: thus he missed seeing the destruction of the great city which
it had in his later years been his passion to destroy. The success of the
highly organized Punic agriculture is said<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> to have been one of the circumstances
that alarmed his keen jealousy: but we can hardly doubt
that he like others got many a hint from the rustic system of Carthage.
Another of his antagonisms was a stubborn opposition to Greek influences.
In the first half of the second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, the time of his
chief activities, these influences were penetrating Roman society more
and more deeply as Roman supremacy spread further and further to
the East. We need not dwell on his denunciations of Greek corruption
in general and warnings against the menace to Roman thrift and
simplicity. A good instance may be found in the injunction<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> to his
son, to have nothing whatever to do with Greek doctors, a pack of
rascals who mean to poison all ‘barbarians,’ who charge fees to
enhance the value of their services, and have the impudence to apply
the term ‘barbarians’ to us. The leader of the good-old-Roman party
was at least thorough in his hates. And his antipathies were not confined
to foreigners and foreign ways, but found ample scope at home
in opposition to the newer school of politicians, whose views were less
narrow and hearty than his own.</p>

<p>In Cato’s time the formation of great landed estates, made easy
by the ruin of many peasant farmers in the second Punic war, was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
full swing. The effective government of Rome was passing more and
more into the hands of the Senate, and the leading nobles did not
neglect their opportunities of adding to their own wealth and power.
Sharing the military appointments, they enriched themselves with
booty and blackmail abroad, particularly in the eastern wars: and,
being by law excluded from open participation in commerce, they invested
a good part of their gains in Italian land. From what we learn
as to the stale of Italy during the last century of the Republic, it seems
certain that this land-grabbing process took place chiefly if not wholly
in the more accessible parts of the country, so far as arable lands were
concerned. Etruria and the districts of central Italy near Rome were
especially affected, and also Lucania. Apulia soon became noted for
its flocks and herds, which grazed there in winter and were driven in
the summer months to the mountain pastures of Samnium. The
pasturage of great private ‘runs’ (<i>saltus</i>) was thus supplemented by
the use of wastes that were still state-property, and the tendency to
monopolize these latter on favourable terms was no doubt still growing.
With the troubles that arose later out of this system of <i>possessiones</i> we
are not here concerned. But the increase of grazing as compared with
tillage is an important point; for that it was the most paying sort of
farming was one of the facts expressly recognised<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> by Cato. The
working of estates on a large scale was promoted by the plentiful
supply of slaves in this period. On arable lands they were now
employed in large gangs, sometimes working in chains, under slave
overseers whose own privileges depended on their getting the utmost
labour out of the common hands. In pastoral districts they enjoyed
much greater freedom. The time was to come when these <i>pastores</i>,
hardy ruffians, often armed against wild beasts, would be a public danger.
But for the present it is probable that one of their chief recommendations
was that they cost next to nothing for their keep.</p>

<p>No man knew better than Cato that it was not on such a land-system
as this that Rome had thriven in the past and risen to her
present greatness. He was proud<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> of having worked hard with his own
hands in youth, and he kept up the practice of simple living on his
own estate, sitting down to meals with the slaves<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> whom he ruled with
the strictness of a practical farmer. Around him was going on the
extension of great ill-managed properties owned by men whom political
business and intrigues kept nearly all the year in Rome, and who gave
little personal attention to the farming of their estates. When the
landlord rebuilt his <i>villa</i>, and used his new country mansion mainly
for entertaining friends, the real charge of the farm more and more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
passed to the plausible slave who was always on the spot as steward.
Cato knew very well that these <i>vilici</i> did not as a rule do the best for
their lords. They had no real interest in getting the most out of the
land. The owner, who wanted ready money for his ambitions and
pleasures, was hardly the man to spend it on material improvements
in hope of an eventual increase of income: thus a steward could easily
find excuses for a low standard of production really due to his own
slackness. All this demoralizing letting-down of agriculture was
anathema to the champion of old-Roman ideas and traditions. It was
a grave factor in the luxury and effeminacy that to his alarm were
undermining the solid virtues of the Roman people. Above all things,
it had what to his intensely Roman nature was the most fatal of
defects—it did not pay. Roman nobles were in fact making their
chief profits out of plundering abroad, and ceasing to exercise old-fashioned
economy at home. With the former evil Cato waged open
war as statesman and orator. How he dealt with the latter as a writer
on agriculture I proceed to inquire.</p>

<p>We may classify the several points of view from which agriculture
could be regarded under a few heads, and see what position in relation
to each of these was taken up by Cato. First, as to the scale of
farming operations. He does not denounce great estates. He insists
on the maintenance of a due proportion<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> between the house and the
land. Neither is to be too big for the other. A decent dwelling<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> will
induce the landlord to visit his estate more often; a fine mansion will
be costly and tempt him to extravagance. Secondly, it is on this
frequent personal attention that successful management depends. For
your steward needs the presence of the master’s eye to keep him to
his duty. Thirdly, he accepts the position that the regular staff of
labourers are to be slaves, and some at least of these<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> are in chains
(<i>compediti</i>). For special work, in time of harvest etc, extra labour is
to be hired, and of this some is free labour, perhaps not all. For contractors
employing gangs of labourers play a considerable part. Their
remuneration may be in cash, or they may receive a share<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> of the produce
(<i>partiario</i>). Some of their labourers are certainly free: if they
do not pay the wages regularly, the <i>dominus</i> is to pay them and
recover from the contractor. But it is not clear that contractors
employed freemen exclusively, and there is some indication<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> of the
contrary. Fourthly, there is no suggestion of a return to quite small
peasant holdings, though he opens the treatise with an edifying passage<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
on the social political and military virtues of farmers, and cites the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
traditional description of <i>virum bonum</i> as being <i>bonum agricolam
bonumque colonum</i>. For his own scheme is not one for enabling a
poor man to win a living for himself and family out of a little patch
of ground. It is farming for profit; and, though not designed for a
big <i>latifundium</i>, it is on a considerable scale. He contemplates<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> an
oliveyard of 240 <i>iugera</i> and a vineyard of 100 <i>iugera</i>, not to mention
all the other departments, and the rigid precepts for preventing waste
and getting the most out of everything are the most striking feature
of his book. The first business<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> of an owner, he says, is not to buy but
to sell. Fifthly, it is important to notice that he does not suggest
letting all or part of the estate to tenants. He starts by giving good
advice as to the pains and caution<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> needed in buying a landed property.
But, once bought, he assumes that the buyer will keep it in hand and
farm it for his own account. It has been said on high authority<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> that
the plan of letting farms to tenant <i>coloni</i> was ‘as old as Italy.’ I do
not venture to deny this. But my inquiry leads me to the conviction
that in early times such an arrangement was extremely rare: the
granting of a plot of land during pleasure (<i>precario</i>) by a patron to a
client was a very different thing. Cato only uses the word<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> <i>colonus</i>
in the general sense of <i>cultivator</i>, and so far as he is concerned we
should never guess that free tenant farmers were known in Italy.
Sixthly, whereas in Varro and Columella we find the influence of later
Greek thought shewn in a desire to treat even rustic slaves as human
and to appeal to the lure of reward rather than the fear of punishment,
to Cato the human chattel seems on the level of the ox.
When past work, both ox and slave are to be sold<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> for what they will
fetch. This he himself says, and his doctrine was duly recorded by
Plutarch as a mark of his hard character. It is therefore not surprising
that he makes no reference to slaves having any quasi-property
(<i>peculium</i>) of their own, though the custom of allowing this privilege
was surely well known to him, and was probably very ancient. If the
final fate of the slave was to be sold as rubbish in order to save his
keep, there was not much point in letting him keep a few fowls or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
grow a few vegetables in some waste corner of the farm. But another
characteristic story raises some doubt in this matter. We are told
that, having remarked that sexual passion was generally the cause of
slaves getting into mischief, he allowed them<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> to have intercourse with
the female slaves at a fixed tariff. Now, to afford himself this indulgence,
a slave must have had a <i>peculium</i>. But Cato did not think
it worth mentioning,—unless of course we assume that a reference
has dropped out of the text. Nor does he refer to manumission: but
we hear of his having a freedman—probably not a farm-slave at all.</p>

<p>Cato’s position, taken as a whole, shews no sign of a reactionary
aim, no uncompromising desire of reversion to a vanished past. Nor
does he fall in with the latest fashion, and treat the huge <i>latifundium</i>
as the last word in landowning. His precepts have in view a fairly
large estate, and perhaps we may infer that he thought this about as
much as a noble landlord, with other calls upon his energies, could
farm through a steward without losing effective control. He does
not, like the Carthaginian Mago, insist on the landlord residing<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
permanently on the estate. In truth he writes as an opportunist.
For this man, who won his fame as the severest critic of his own
times, knew very well that contemporary Romans of good station
and property would never consent to abdicate their part in public
life and settle down to merely rustic interests. Nor indeed would
such retirement have been consistent with Roman traditions. But
conditions had greatly changed since the days of the farmer-nobles
who could easily attend the Senate or Assembly at short notice. The
far greater extent of territory over which modern estates were spread
made it impossible to assume that they all lay near the city. And
yet the attraction of Rome was greater than ever. It was the centre
and head of a dominion already great, and in Cato’s day ever
growing. The great critic might declaim against the methods and
effects of this or that particular conquest and denounce the iniquities
of Roman officials: but he himself bore no light hand in advancing
the power of Rome, and thereby in making Rome the focus of the
intrigues and ambitions of the Mediterranean world. So he accepted
the land-system of the new age, and with it the great extension of
slave-labour and slave-management, and tried to shew by what devotion
and under what conditions it could be made to pay. It must be
borne in mind that slave-labour on the land was no new thing. It
was there from time immemorial, ready for organization on a large
scale; and it was this extension of an existing institution that was
new. Agriculture had once been to the ordinary Roman citizen the
means of livelihood. It was now, in great part of the most strictly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Roman districts of Italy, becoming industrialized as a field for investment
of capital by the senatorial class, who practically controlled the
government and were debarred from openly engaging in commerce.
The exploitation of rustic properties as income-producing securities
was merely a new phase of the grasping hard-fisted greed characteristic
of the average Roman. Polybius, observing Roman life in this very
age with Greek eyes, was deeply impressed<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> by this almost universal
quality. And Cato himself was a Roman of Romans. Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> has
preserved for us the tradition of his economic career. As a young
man of small means he led the hard life of a farmer, as he was not
shy of boasting<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> in later years, and was a strict master of slaves. But
he did not find farming sufficiently remunerative, so he embarked on
other enterprises. Farming remained rather as a pastime than a
source of income: but he took to safe and steady investments, such
as rights over lakes, hot springs, fullers’ premises, and land that could
be turned to profit<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> through the presence of natural pasture and woodland.
From these properties he drew large returns not dependent on the
weather. By employing a freedman as his agent, he lent money on
bottomry, eluding the legal restriction on senators; and by combining
with partners in the transaction he distributed and so minimized the
risks of a most profitable business. And all through life he dealt in
slaves<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>, buying them young, training them, and selling at an enhanced
price any that he did not want himself. He bred some on his estate,
probably not many. It is said that, in addition to her own children,
his wife would suckle<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> slave-babies, as a means of promoting good
feeling in the household towards her son.</p>

<p>In these details, of the general truth of which there is no reasonable
doubt, we have a picture of a man of astounding versatility and
force: for of his political and military activities I have said nothing.
But as a writer on agriculture how are we to regard him? Surely not
as a thoroughgoing reformer. His experience had taught him that,
if you must have a good income (a point on which he and his contemporaries
were agreed), you had better not look to get it from
farming. But if for land-pride or other reasons you must needs farm,
Cato is ready to give you the best practical advice. That many (if indeed
any) men of property would take the infinite trouble and pains that
his system requires from a landlord, he was probably too wise to
believe. But that was their business. He spoke<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> as an oracle; as in
public life ‘take it or leave it’ was the spirit of his utterances. The
evidence of his life and of his book, taken together, is more clear as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
shewing the unsatisfactory position of rustic enterprise than from any
other point of view.</p>

<p>A few details relative to the staff employed on the estate are
worthy of a brief notice. Cato is keenly alive to the importance of
the labour-question. In choosing an estate you must ascertain that
there is a sufficient local supply<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> of labour. On the face of it this
seems to mean free wage-earning labour, though the word <i>operarius</i>
is neutral. But in a notable passage, in which he sets forth the advantage
of being on friendly terms with neighbours (neighbouring landlords),
he says ‘Don’t let your household (<i>familiam</i>) do damage: if
you are in favour with the neighbourhood, you will find it easier to
sell your stock, easier<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> to get employment for your own staff at a
wage, easier to hire hands: and if you are engaged in building they
(the <i>vicini</i>) will give you help in the way of human and animal
labour and timber.’ Here we seem to come upon the hiring, not of
free labourers, but of a neighbour’s slave hands on payment of a rent
to their owner. The case would arise only when some special rough
job called for a temporary supply of more labour. It would be the
landlord’s interest to keep his neighbours inclined to oblige him.
Thus by mutual accommodation in times of pressure it was possible
to do with a less total of slaves than if each farm had had to be provided
with enough labour for emergencies. We may also remark
that it made the slaveowner less dependent on free wage-earners, who
would probably have raised their demands when they saw the landlord
at their mercy. It must always be borne in mind that Cato is
writing solely from the landlord’s point of view.</p>

<p>The leading fact relative to the staff is that the steward or head
man (<i>vilicus</i>) under whom the various workers, slave or free, are
employed is himself a slave. So too the <i>vilica</i>, usually his consort.
Their position is made quite clear by liability to punishment and by
their disqualification<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> from performance of all save the most ordinary
and trivial religious ceremonies. Their duties are defined by jealous
regulations. But in order to keep the steward up to the mark the
master must often visit the estate. It is significant that he is advised
on arrival to make a round of the place<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> without delay, and not to
question his steward until he has thus formed his own impressions
independently. Then he can audit accounts, check stores, listen to
excuses, give orders, and reprimand failure or neglect. That the
master needed to be a man of knowledge and energy in order to
make his estate a source of profit when in charge of a steward, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
evident. It may well be that Cato insists so strongly on the need of
these qualities because they were becoming rare among the nobles of
his day. But, though he knew that the efficiency of a slave steward
could only be maintained by constant and expert watching, he never
suggests the employment of a free man in that capacity. The truth
seems to be that the ‘Manager,’ a man paid by salary or percentage
and kept up to the mark by fear of ‘losing his place,’ is a comparatively
modern figure. In antiquity the employment of Freedmen in
positions of trust was a move in that direction, though patrons kept a
considerable hold, beyond the purely economic one, on their freedmen.
But for charge of a farm Cato does not suggest employment of
a freedman.</p>

<p>The blending of free and slave labour might well have been
brought out more clearly than it is: but to the author writing for his
own contemporaries it would seem needless to enlarge upon a condition
which everyone took for granted. Yet there are passages
where it is indicated plainly enough. Thus in the olive-press room
a bed is provided<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> for two free <i>custodes</i> (apparently foremen) out of
three: the third, a slave, is put to sleep with the <i>factores</i>, who seem
to be the hands employed<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> to work the press, probably slaves, whose
labour is merely bodily exertion. The <i>leguli</i> who gather up the olives
are probably free, for they are interested<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> in making the amount so
gathered as large as possible. Strippers, <i>strictores</i>, who pluck the
olives from the tree, are also mentioned<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> in the chapter dealing with
the harvesting of a hanging crop by a contractor. As the need of care
to avoid damaging the trees is insisted on, and all the workers are
to take a solemn oath<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> that they have stolen none of the crop, we
may fairly infer that they are freemen. When the process of manufacture
is let to a contractor, his <i>factores</i> are to take a similar oath,
and are probably free. So too when a crop is sold hanging: if the
buyer neglects to pay<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> his <i>leguli</i> and <i>factores</i> (which would cause
delay) the landlord may pay them himself and recover the amount
from the buyer. On the other hand in the grazing department the
underlings are slaves. In case of the sale of winter grazing, provision
is made<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> for an arbitration for settlement of damages done by the
<i>emptor aut pastores aut pecus emptoris</i> to the <i>dominus</i>, or by the <i>dominus
aut familia aut pecus</i> to the <i>emptor</i>. And, until the compensation
awarded is paid, the <i>pecus aut familia</i> on the ground is to be held in
pledge by the party to whom compensation is due. This would
generally be the landlord, and the <i>familia</i> of the <i>emptor</i> would be his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
<i>pastores</i>. Even so, when a speculator buys the season’s lambs, he
provides a <i>pastor</i> for two months, and the man is held in pledge<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> by
the landlord until the account is finally settled.</p>

<p>There are casual references to other persons employed on the
estate whose condition has to be inferred from various indications
with more or less certainty. Thus the <i>capulator</i>, who draws off the
oil from the press into vessels, is connected with the <i>custos</i><a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> and is
not clearly distinct from him. He may be a slave, but the call for
strict cleanliness and care at this stage of the operations rather
suggests the free wage-earner. An <i>epistates</i> is mentioned<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> in a chapter
on food-rations (<i>familiae cibaria</i>), and grouped with the <i>vilicus</i> and
<i>vilica</i> and the <i>opilio</i>. They receive less food than the common hands
engaged in rough manual labour. They are probably all slaves, the
<i>epistates</i> being a foreman of some sort, and the <i>opilio</i> the head
shepherd, the <i>magister pecoris</i> of whom we often hear later. In the
estimates<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> of the equipment required for a farm with oliveyard or
vineyard the human staff is included with the other live and dead
stock. The <i>operarii</i> mentioned in this connexion are evidently slave
hands, and the <i>bubulcus<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> subulcus asinarius opilio</i> and <i>salictarius</i> are
the same, only specialized in function. For an oliveyard of 240 <i>iugera</i>
the human staff is put at 13 (<i>summa homines xiii</i>), for a vineyard of
100 <i>iugera</i> it is 16, and the <i>operarii</i> in particular are 10 as against 5.
The greater amount of digging<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> needed on a farm chiefly devoted to
vines is the reason of the difference. These estimates are for the
permanent staff, the <i>familia</i>, owned by the landlords in the same
way as the oxen asses mules sheep goats or pigs. So far as common
daily labour is concerned, this staff should make the farm self-sufficing.</p>

<p>But there were many operations, connected with the life of the farm,
for performing which it was either not desirable or not possible to rely
on the regular staff. It would never have paid to maintain men skilled
in the work of special trades only needed on rare occasions. Thus for
erecting buildings the <i>faber</i><a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> is called in: the landlord finds materials,
the builder uses them and is paid for his work. Lime is needed for
various purposes, and it may be worth while<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> to have a kiln on the
estate and do the burning there. But even so it is well to employ a
regular limeburner (<i>calcarius</i>) for the job. The landlord finds limestone
and fuel, and a way of payment is to work on shares (<i>partiario</i>) each
party taking his share of the lime. The same share-system (according
to Keil’s text) is proposed for the operation known as <i>politio</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
seems to include<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> weeding and ‘cleaning’ of the land, at least for cereal
crops, and also is prescribed for the skilled tending of a vineyard. For
such works as these it is fairly certain that the persons employed were
assumed to be living in the neighbourhood. In the case of the blacksmith<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>
(<i>faber ferrarius</i>) there can be no doubt, for his forge is spoken of as a
fit place for drying grapes, hung presumably in the smoke of his wood
fire. Now all these skilled men are evidently free, and work on agreed
terms. Some of them are certainly not singlehanded, but whether their
underlings are freemen or slaves or both we are left to guess. In all
cases their work is such as calls not only for skill and industry but also
for good faith, which cannot be expected from slaves. It is in short
contract-work, whether the bargain be made in a formal agreement or
not.</p>

<p>The employment of contractors, each with his own staff, at times
of pressure such as the getting in and disposal of crops, has been referred
to above, and it has been remarked that some at least of this emergency-labour
was performed by freemen. We must therefore conclude that
in Cato’s time there was a considerable supply of casual labourers in
country districts, on whose services landlords could rely. The contractor
would seem to have been either a ‘ganger’ who bargained for terms
with the landlord on behalf of his work-party, or a capitalist owning a
gang of slaves. What made the difference would be the nature of the
job in hand, according as skill or mere brute strength was chiefly required.
But that slave labour was the essential factor, on which Catonian
agriculture normally depended, is beyond all doubt. The slave
steward is not only responsible<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> for the control of the slave staff (<i>familia</i>)
and their wellbeing and profitable employment. He is authorized to
employ other labour, even free labour, at need; only he must not keep
such persons hanging about the place. He is to pay them off and
discharge them without delay, no doubt in order to prevent them from
unsettling the slaves by their presence. And slaves must never be idle.
When a master calls his steward to account for insufficient results on
the farm, the latter is expected to plead in excuse not only the weather
but shortage of hands; slaves have been sick or have run away; or they
have been employed<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> on state-work (<i>opus publicum effecisse</i>),—probably
in mending the roads, for this is recognized below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">XXIV. AGRICULTURE IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD.</h3>

<p>From the death of Cato in 149 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> to the date of Varro’s book <i>de
re rustica</i> (about 37 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) is a space of more than a century. The one
great fact of this momentous period in relation to agriculture is the
public recognition of the decay of the small farmers over a large part
of Italy, and the vain attempt to revive a class well known to have
been the backbone of Roman strength. But the absorption of small
holdings in large estates had already gone so far in the affected districts
that there was practically only one direction in which land-reformers
could move. To confiscate private property was forbidden by Roman
respect for legal rights: it appears in Roman history only after the
failure of the Gracchan movement, and as a phenomenon of civil war.
There were however great areas of land of which the state was still in
law proprietor, held by individuals (often in very large blocks) under
a system of recognized occupation known as <i>possessio</i>. Tradition
alleged that in Rome’s early days this <i>ager publicus</i> had been a cause
of quarrels between the needy Commons who hungered for land and
the rich nobles who strove to monopolize the land annexed by war and
now state-property. It was known that one of the effects produced by
the political equalization of the Orders in the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> had
been legislation to restrain land-monopoly. But the Licinian laws of
367 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> had not made an end of the evil. Soon evaded, they had become
in course of time wholly inoperative. The new Patricio-Plebeian
nobility quieted the claims of the poor by colonial foundations and
allotments of land in newly-conquered districts, while they continued
to enrich themselves by ‘possession’ of the public land. Undisturbed
possession gradually obscured the distinction between such holdings
and the estates held in full ownership as <i>ager privatus</i>. Boundaries
were confused: mixed estates changed hands by inheritance or sale
without recognition of a legal difference in the tenure of different portions:
where improvements had been carried out, they applied indistinguishably
to lands owned or possessed. The greater part of these <i>possessiones</i>
was probably not arable but pasture, grazed by numerous flocks and
herds in charge of slave herdsmen. Now in Cato’s time the imports
of foreign corn were already rendering the growth of cereal crops for
the market an unremunerative enterprise in the most accessible parts
of Italy. Grazing paid better. It required fewer hands, but considerable
capital and wide areas of pasturage. It could be combined with the
culture of the vine and olive; for the live-stock, brought down to the
farmstead in the winter months, supplied plentiful manure. Moreover,
the wholesale employment of slaves enabled a landlord to rely on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
regular supply of labour. The slave was not liable to military service:
so the master was not liable to have his staff called up at short notice.
In short, economic influences, aided by selfish or corrupt administration
of the laws under the rule of the nobility, gave every advantage to the
rich landlords. No wonder that patriotic reformers viewed the prospect
with alarm, and sought some way of promoting a revival of the peasant
farmers.</p>

<p>The story of the Gracchan movement and the causes of its failure
are set forth from various points of view in histories<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> of Rome and
special monographs. What concerns us here is to remark that its
remedial legislation dealt solely with land belonging to the state and
occupied by individuals. Power was taken to ascertain its boundaries,
to resume possession on behalf of the state, and to parcel it out in allotments
among needy citizens. How far success in the aim of restoring
a free citizen population in the denuded districts was ever possible, we
cannot tell. But we know that it did not in fact succeed. By 111 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>
whatever had been achieved<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> was finally annulled. The bulk of the <i>ager
publicus</i> had disappeared. The sale of land-allotments, at first forbidden,
had been permitted, and the process of buying out the newly created
peasantry went on freely. But large estates formed under the new
conditions were subject to no defect of title. They were strictly private
property, though the term <i>possessiones</i> still remained in use. Slave-labour
on such estates was normal as before. Indeed rustic slavery
was now at its height. This short period of attempted land-reform
comes between the two great Sicilian slave-wars (135-2 and 103-99
<span class="allsmcap">BC</span>), in the events of which the horrors of contemporary agriculture
were most vividly expressed. It was also a time of great wars abroad,
in Gaul, in Africa, and against the barbarian invaders from the North.
Roman armies suffered many defeats, and the prestige of Roman power
was only restored by the military remodelling under Marius. When
Marius finally threw over the principle that military service was a duty
required of propertied citizens, and raised legions from the poorest
classes, volunteering with an eye to profit, he in effect founded the
Empire. We can hardly help asking<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> from what quarters he was able
to draw these recruits. Some no doubt were idlers already living in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Rome attracted by the distributions of cheap corn provided by the
Government in order to keep quiet the city mob. But these can hardly
have been a majority of the recruits of this class. Probably a number
came in from rural districts, hearing that Marius was calling for volunteers
and prepared to disregard altogether the obsolete rules which had
on occasion been evaded by others before him. It is perhaps not too
bold a conjecture to suggest that the casual wage-earners, the <i>mercennarii</i>
referred to by Cato, were an important element in the New Model
army of Marius. This landless class, living from hand to mouth, may
have been declining in numbers, but they were by no means extinct.
We meet them later in Varro and elsewhere. And no man knew better
than Marius the military value of men hardened by field-labour, particularly
when led to volunteer by hopes of earning a higher reward in
a career of more perils and less monotony.</p>

<p>It can hardly be supposed that agriculture throve under the conditions
prevailing in these troubled years. The tendency must have been
to reduce the number of free rustic wage-earners, while each war would
bring captives to the slave-market. We can only guess at these
economic effects. The following period of civil wars, from the Italian
rising in 90 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> to the death of Sulla in 78, led to a further and more
serious disturbance of the land-system. The dictator had to reward
his soldiery, and that promptly. The debt was discharged by grants
of land, private land, the owners of which were either ejected for the
purpose or had been put to death. Of the results of this wholesale
confiscation and allotment we have abundant evidence, chiefly from
Cicero. Making full allowance for exaggeration and partisan feeling,
it remains sufficient to shew that Sulla’s military colonists were
economically a disastrous failure, while both they and the men dispossessed
to make room for them soon became a grave political danger.
The discharged soldiers desired an easy life as proprietors, and the
excitements of warfare had unfitted them for the patient economy of
farming. They bought slaves; but slaves cost money, and the profitable
direction of slave-labour was an art calling for a degree of watchfulness
and skill that few landlords of any class were willing or able to exert.
So this substitution of new landowners for old was an unmixed evil:
the new men failed as farmers, and we hardly need to be told that the
feeling of insecurity produced by the confiscations was a check on
agricultural improvements for the time. Those of the ‘Sullan men’ who
sold their allotments (evading the law) would certainly not get a good
price, and the money would soon melt away.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the old Roman system, under which the ordinary
citizen was a peasant farmer who served the state as a soldier when
needed, was practically at an end. Compulsory levies were on certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
occasions resorted to, for no abolition of the old liability to service had
taken place: but voluntary enlistment of young men, and their conversion
into professional soldiers by technical training, was henceforth the
normal method of forming Roman armies. Armies were kept on foot
for long campaigns, and the problem of their peaceful disbandment was
one of the most serious difficulties of the revolutionary age. The treasury
had no large income to spend on money-pensions, so the demand
for allotments of land became a regular accompaniment of demobilization.
Meanwhile the desperate condition of landlords in important
districts, and the danger from the slave-gangs, were forcibly illustrated
in the rising under Spartacus (73-1 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>) and the Catilinarian conspiracy.
It is unfortunate that the scope of the land-bill of Rullus<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> in 63, defeated
by Cicero, is uncertain, and the effect of Caesar’s land-law of 59 hardly
less so. But one thing seems clear. In default of sufficient lands suitable
for allotment, legislators were driven to propose the resumption
of the rich Campanian domain. This public estate had long been let
to tenants, real farmers, in small holdings; and the rents therefrom
were one of the safest sources of public income. To disturb good
tenants, and give the best land in Italy to untried men as owners, was
surely a bad business. It shews to what straits rulers were driven to
find land for distribution. To enter into the details of the various land-allotments
between the abortive proposal of Rullus and the final
settlement of Octavian would be out of place here. But it is well to
note that the plan of purchasing private land for pension-allotments,
proposed in the bill of Rullus, was actually carried out by the new
Emperor and proudly recorded<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> by him in his famous record of the
achievements of his life. The violent transfer of landed properties from
present holders to discharged soldiers of the triumviral armies had
evidently been both an economic failure and a political evil. To pay
for estates taken for purpose of distribution was a notable step towards
restoration of legality and public confidence. Whether it immediately
brought about a revival of agriculture on a sound footing is a question
on which opinions may justifiably differ. Much will depend on the view
taken by this or that inquirer of the evidence of Varro and the Augustan
poets Horace and Vergil.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXV">XXV. VARRO.</h3>

<p><b>M Terentius Varro</b> wrote his treatise <i>de re rustica</i> in 37-6 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> at
the age of 80. The subject was only one of an immense number to
which he devoted his talents and wide learning when not actively
engaged in public duties. The last republican rally under Brutus
and Cassius had failed at Philippi in 42, and the Roman world was
shared out between the Triumvirs. In 36 the suppression of Lepidus
declared what was already obvious, that Antony and Octavian were
the real holders of power and probable rivals. Proscriptions, confiscations,
land-allotments to soldiers, the wars with Antony’s brother
Lucius and the great Pompey’s son Sextus, had added to the unsettlement
and exhaustion of Italy. If it appeared to Varro that a
treatise on farming would be opportune (and we may fairly conjecture
that it did), there was surely much to justify his opinion in the
distressful state of many parts of the country. But at this point we
are met by a passage<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> in the work itself which seems to prove that
he took a very different view of present agricultural conditions in
Italy. Some of the speakers (the book is in form a dialogue) declare
that no country is better cultivated than Italy, that no other country
is so fully cultivated all through (<i>tota</i>), that Italian crops are in
general the best of their several kinds, and in particular that Italy is
one great orchard. Instances in point are given. That Varro, like
Cicero, took great care<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> to avoid anachronisms and improbabilities,
that his characters are real persons, and that he tries hard to fit the
several topics to the several characters, is not to be denied. But it is
perhaps too much to assume that such general remarks as those just
cited are meant to represent the known personal opinions of the
speakers. If we could be sure of the date at which the dialogue is
supposed to be held, we might have a more satisfactory standard for
estimating the significance and historical value of these utterances.
Unluckily we have no convincing evidence as to the intended date.
The scene of the second book can be laid in 67 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> with reasonable
certainty, and that of the third in 54 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. But no passage occurs in
the first book sufficient to furnish material for a like inference. When
Stolo refers<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> to Varro’s presence with the fleet and army at Corcyra,
some have thought that he has in mind the time of the civil war in
49 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>.
    It is much more likely that the reference is to Varro’s service<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
as one of Pompey’s lieutenants in the pirate war of 67 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. The
dialogue of Book <span class="allsmcap">I</span> would then be placed after the summer of that
year, probably not much later. The boast of the speakers as to the
splendid cultivation of Italy in general would refer to the time when
the disturbance caused by the confiscations and assignations of Sulla
was dying down and the rising of Spartacus had lately been suppressed.
It would be placed before the later disturbances caused by measures
designed to satisfy the claims of Pompeian Caesarian and Triumviral
armies. Vergil had not yet been driven from his Cisalpine farm.</p>

<p>Whether by placing Book <span class="allsmcap">I</span> in this interval, and by supposing
that the circumstances of that time would fit the utterances of Varro’s
characters, I am exceeding the limits of sober guesswork, I cannot
judge. But I am convinced that in any case upland pastures and
forest-lands<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> accounted for a very large part of the surface of Italy
then, as they do still. Indeed Varro recognizes this in his references
to the migration of flocks and herds according to the seasons, and
particularly when he notes not only the great stretches of rough land
to be traversed but also the need of active and sturdy <i>pastores</i> able to
beat off the assaults of wild beasts and robbers. Surely the complete
cultivation of Italy, compared as it is with that of other countries, is
a description not to be taken literally, but as a natural exaggeration
in the mouth of a self-complacent Roman agriculturist. Be this as it
may, the treatise marks a great advance on that of Cato in some
respects. Many details are common to both writers, in particular the
repeated insistence on the main principle that whatever the farmer
does must be made to pay. Profit, not sentiment or fancy, was their
common and truly Roman aim. But in the century or more that had
elapsed since Cato wrote other authors (such as Saserna) had treated of
farming, and much had been learnt from Greek and Punic authorities.
Knowledge of the products and practices of foreign lands had greatly
increased, and Varro, who had himself added to this store, made free
use of the wider range of facts now at the service of inquirers. And
the enlarged outlook called for a systematic method. Accordingly
Varro’s work is clearly divided into three discussions, of tillage
(Book <span class="allsmcap">I</span>), grazing and stock-breeding (<span class="allsmcap">II</span>), and keeping fancy animals
(<span class="allsmcap">III</span>) chiefly to supply the market for table-luxuries. And he goes
into detail in a spirit different from that of Cato. Cato jerked out
dogmatic precepts when he thought fit, for instance his wonderful
list of farm-requisites. Varro is more concerned with the principles,
the reasons for preferring this or that method, derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
theories and experience of the past. For instance, in estimating the
staff required, he insists<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> on its being proportioned to the scale of the
work to be done: as the average day’s work (<i>opera</i>) varies in efficiency
according to the soil, it is not possible to assign a definite number of
hands to a farm of definite area. Nor is he content simply to take
slave-labour, supplemented by hired free labour and contract-work,
for granted. In a short but important passage he discusses the
labour-question, with reasons for the preference of this or that class
of labour for this or that purpose, of course preferring whichever is
likely to give the maximum of profit with the minimum of loss.</p>

<p>It is this passage<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> that is chiefly of interest from my present point
of view, and I will therefore translate it in full.</p>

<p>‘So much for the four conditions<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> of the farm that are connected
with the soil, and the second four external to the farm but bearing
on its cultivation. Now for the appliances used in tillage. Some
classify these under two heads (<i>a</i>) men (<i>b</i>) the implements necessary
for their work. Others under three<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> heads (<i>a</i>) the possessed of true
speech (<i>b</i>) the possessed of inarticulate speech (<i>c</i>) the speechless. In
these classes respectively are included<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> (<i>a</i>) slaves (<i>b</i>) oxen (<i>c</i>) waggons,
and such are the three kinds of equipment. The men employed in
all tillage are either slaves or freemen or both. Free labour is seen
in the case of those who till their<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
    land themselves, as poor peasants<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
with the help of their families mostly do: or in that of wage-earners<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>,
as when a farmer hires free hands to carry out the more important
operations on his farm, vintage or hay-harvest and the like: such also
are those who were called “tied men”<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> in Italy, a class still numerous
in Asia Egypt and Illyricum. Speaking of these<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> as a class, I maintain
that in the tillage of malarious land<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> it pays better to employ
free wage-earners than slaves; even in a healthy spot the more important
operations, such as getting in vintage or harvest, are best so
managed. As to their qualities, Cassius writes thus: in buying<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>
labourers you are to choose men fit for heavy work, not less than 22
years of age and ready to learn farm-duties. This you can infer from
giving them other tasks and seeing how they perform them, or by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
questioning<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> new slaves as to the work they used to do under their
former owner. Slaves should be neither timid nor high-spirited.
Their overseers<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> should be men able to read and write, in fact with a
touch of education, honest fellows, somewhat older than the mere
labourers just mentioned. For these are more willing to obey their
elders. Above all things the one indispensable quality in overseers is
practical knowledge of farming. For the overseer is not only to give
orders, but to take part in carrying them out; so that the slave may
do as he sees the overseer do, and note the reasonableness of his own
subordination to one his superior in knowledge. On the other hand
the overseer should not be allowed to enforce obedience by the lash
rather than by reprimand,—of course supposing that the same effect<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
is produced. Again, you should not buy too many slaves of the same
race, for nothing breeds trouble in the household<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> more than this.
For the overseers there should be rewards to make them keen in
their work: care should be taken to allow them a private store<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and
slave concubines to bear them children, a tie which steadies them and
binds them more closely to the estate. It is these family ties that
distinguish the slave-gangs from Epirus and give them a high
market-value. You should grant favours to overseers to gain their
goodwill, and also to the most efficient of the common hands; with
these it is also well to talk over the work that is to be undertaken, for
it makes them think that their owner takes some account of them
and does not utterly despise them. They can be given more interest
in their work by more generous treatment in the way of food or
clothing, or by a holiday or by leave to keep a beast or so of their
own at grass on the estate, or other privileges: thus any who have
been overtasked or punished may find some comfort<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> and recover their
ready goodwill towards their owner.’</p>

<p>This passage well illustrates the advance in scientific treatment of
the subject since the time of Cato. The analysis and classification
may not be very profound, but it tends to orderly method, not to
oracles. The influence of Greek writings is to be traced, for instance
in the rules for the choice and treatment of slaves. The writings of
Aristotle and his school had been studied in Rome since the great
collection had been brought by Sulla from the East. How far Varro
actually borrows from Aristotle or Plato or Xenophon is not always
easy to say. The advice to avoid getting too many slaves of one race<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
or too spirited, and to use sexual relations as a restraining tie, were
by this time common-places of slave-management, and appear under
Cato in somewhat cruder practical forms. But Varro is involved in
the difficulties that have ever beset those who try to work on double
principles, to treat the slave as at once the chattel of an owner and a
partner in common humanity. So he tells his reader ‘manage your
slaves as men, if you can get them to obey you on those terms; if
not,—well, you must make them obey—flog them.’ Humanitarian
principles have not gone far in the system of Varro, who looks solely
from the master’s point of view. The master gets rather more out of
his slaves when they work to gain privileges than when they work
merely to escape immediate punishment. So he is willing to offer
privileges, and the prospect of promotion to the higher ranks of the
staff. Overseers and the best of the common hands may form a little
quasi-property of their own by the master’s leave. But these <i>peculia</i>
do not seem to be a step on the road to manumission, of which we
hear nothing in this treatise. We are left to infer that rustic slaves on
estates generally remained there when past active work, tolerated
hangers-on, living on what they could pick up, and that to have
acquired some <i>peculium</i> was a comfortable resource in old age. In
short, the hopes of the worn-out rustic bondman were limited indeed.</p>

<p>When we note Varro’s attitude towards free labour we cannot
wonder that humanitarianism is not conspicuous in his treatment of
slavery. Hired men are more to be trusted than slaves, so you will
employ them, as Cato advised, for jobs that need care and honesty
and that cannot wait. But he adds a sinister hint as to employing
them on work dangerous to health. Your own slaves for whom you
have paid good money are too valuable to be exposed to such risks.
The great merit of the <i>mercennarius</i> is that, when the job is done and
his wage paid, you have done with him and have no further responsibility.
This brutally industrial view is closely connected with the
legal atmosphere of Roman civilization, in which Varro lived and
moved. The debtor discharging his debt by serving his creditor as a
farm-hand, once an ordinary figure in Italy, was now only found
abroad: Varro mentions this unhappy class, for he is not thinking of
Italy alone. It is interesting to hear from him that peasant-farmers
were not extinct in Italy. But we are not told whether they were still
numerous or whether they were mostly to be found in certain districts,
as from other authorities we are tempted to infer. Nor do we learn
whether men with small farms of their own often went out as wage-earners;
nor again whether landless <i>mercennarii</i> were in his time a
numerous class. These omissions make it very difficult for us to form
any clear and trustworthy picture of rural conditions as they presented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
themselves to Varro. It would seem that they were in general much
the same as in Cato’s time, but that Varro is more inclined to discuss
openly some details that Cato took for granted. So in his turn Varro
takes some things for granted, passing lightly over details that we
cannot but wish to know.</p>

<p>There is however one important matter, ignored by Cato (at least
in his text as we have it), to which reference is found in Varro. It is
the presence of the free tenant farmer (<i>colonus</i>) in the agricultural
system of Italy. He tells us that the formal lease<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> of a farm usually
contained a clause by which the <i>colonus</i> was forbidden to graze a she-goat’s
offspring on the farm. In another passage<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> the same prohibition
is mentioned, but with this limitation, that it applies only to land
planted with immature saplings. So poisonous were the teeth of
nibbling goats thought to be. The restriction imposed on the tenant
suggests that the landlord was bargaining at an advantage; the lessor
could dictate his terms to the lessee. That the tenant farmers of this
period were at least in some cases humble dependants of their landlords
is clearly shewn by a passage<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> of Caesar. In order to hold
Massalia for Pompey in 49 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, Domitius raised a squadron of seven
ships, the crews for which he made up from his own<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> slaves freedmen
and tenants. Soon after he refers to this force<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> as the tenants and
herdsmen brought by Domitius. These herdsmen are no doubt some
of the slaves before mentioned. It is evident that the free retainers
called tenants are not conceived as having much choice in the matter
when their noble lord called them out for service. Probably their
effective freedom consisted in the right to own property (if they could
get it), to make wills, to rear children of their own, and other like
privileges. But their landlord would have so great a hold<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> on them
that, though in theory freemen, they were in practice compelled to do
his bidding. In later times we shall find the tenant farmer a common
figure in rural life, but very dependent on his landlord; and it is by
no means clear that his position had ever been a strong and independent
one. Of Varro all we can say is that he does refer to farm-tenancy
as a business-relation, and infer from his words that in that
relation the landowner had the upper hand.</p>

<p>Beside what we may call the legal sense of ‘tenant,’ Varro also uses
<i>colonus</i> in its older sense of ‘cultivator.’ In discussing the convenience
of being able to supply farm needs, and dispose of farm surplus, in the
neighbourhood, he points out that the presence or absence of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
advantage may make all the difference whether a farm can be made to
pay or not. For instance, it is seldom worth while to keep skilled
craftsmen<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> of your own: the death of one such specialist sweeps away
the (year’s) profit of the farm. Only rich landowners can provide for
such services in their regular staff. So the usual practice of <i>coloni</i> is to
rely on local men for such services, paying a yearly fee and having a
right to their attendance at call. The <i>coloni</i> here are simply ‘farmers,’
and there is nothing to shew that they do not own their farms. The
connexion with the verb <i>colere</i> appears even more strongly where
<i>pastor</i> is contrasted<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> with <i>colonus</i>, grazier with tiller: and in that passage
the <i>colonus</i> is apparently identical with the <i>dominus fundi</i> just below.
The <i>coloni</i> of these passages can hardly be mere tenants, but on the other
hand they are certainly not great landowners. They seem to be men
farming their own land, but in a small way<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> of business. Whether
there were many such people in Varro’s Italy, he does not tell us. Nor
do we find any indication to shew whether they would normally take
part in farm work with their own hands. When he deplores<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> the modern
tendency to crowd into the city, where men use their hands for applauding
shows, having abandoned the sickle and the plough, he is
merely repeating the common lament of reformers. There is no sign
of any hope of serious reaction against this tendency: the importation
and cheap distribution of foreign corn is a degenerate and ruinous
policy, but there it is. Varro admired the small holdings and peasant
farmers of yore, but no man knew better that independent rustic citizens
of that type had passed away from the chief arable districts of Italy
never to return.</p>

<p>That small undertakings were still carried on in the neighbourhood
of Rome and other urban centres, is evident from the market-gardens
of the Imperial age. A notable case<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> is that of the bee-farm of a single
<i>iugerum</i> worked at a good profit by two brothers about 30 miles north
of Rome. Varro expressly notes that they were able to bide their time
so as not to sell on a bad market. He had first-hand knowledge of
these men, who had served under him in Spain. Clearly they were
citizens. They can hardly have kept slaves. It seems to have been a
very exceptional case, and to be cited as such: it is very different from
that of the peasant farmer of early Rome, concerned first of all to
grow food for himself and his family. Agriculture as treated by Varro
is based on slave labour, and no small part of his work deals with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
quarters, feeding, clothing, discipline, sanitation, and mating, of the
slave staff. True to his legal bent, he is careful to safeguard the rights
of the slaveowner by explaining<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> the formal details necessary to effect
a valid purchase, with guarantee of bodily soundness, freedom from
vice, and flawless title. Again, to keep slaves profitably it was urgently
necessary to keep them constantly employed, so that the capital sunk
in them should not lie idle and the hands lose the habit of industry.
Therefore, while relying on local craftsmen for special skilled services
occasionally needed, he insists that a number of rustic articles should
be manufactured on the farm. ‘One ought not to buy anything that
can be produced on the estate<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> and made up by the staff (<i>domesticis</i> =
<i>familia</i>), such as wicker work and things made of rough wood.’ Moreover,
the organization of the staff in departments is an elaborate slave-hierarchy.
Under the general direction of the <i>vilicus</i>, each separate
function of tillage or grazing, or keeping and fattening fancy-stock has
its proper foreman. Such posts carried little privileges, and were of
course tenable during good behaviour. Some foremen would have
several common hands under them: none would wish to be degraded
back to the ranks. It seems that some wealthy men kept<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> birdcatchers
huntsmen or fishermen of their own, but Varro, writing for the average
landlord, seems to regard these as being properly free professionals.
As for the common hands, the ‘labourers’ (<i>operarii</i>), on whose bone
and sinew the whole economic structure rested, their condition was
much the same as in Cato’s time, but apparently somewhat less wretched.
Varro does not propose to sell off worn-out slaves; this let us credit
to humaner feelings. He shews a marked regard for the health and
comfort of slaves; this may be partly humanity, but that it is also due
to an enlightened perception of the owner’s interest is certain. He does
not provide for an <i>ergastulum</i>, though those horrible prisons were well
known in his day. Why is this? Perhaps partly because slave-labour
was no longer normally employed on estates in the extremely crude
and brutal fashion that was customary in the second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. And
partly perhaps owing to the great disturbances of land-tenure since
the measures of the Gracchi and the confiscations of Sulla. The earlier
<i>latifundia</i> had been in their glory when the wealthy nobles sat securely
in power, and this security was for the present at an end. But, if the
slave <i>operarii</i> were somewhat better treated, their actual field labour
was probably no less hard. Many pieces of land could not be worked
with the clumsy and superficial plough then in use. Either the slope
of the ground forbade it, or a deeper turning of the soil was needed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
as for growing<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> vines. This meant wholesale digging, and the slave
was in effect a navvy without pay or respite. No wonder that <i>fossor</i>
became a proverbial term for mere animal strength and dull unadaptability.
An interesting estimate of the capability of an average digger
is quoted<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> from Saserna. One man can dig over 8 <i>iugera</i> in 45 days.
But 4 day’s work is enough for one <i>iugerum</i> (about ⅝ of an acre). The
13 spare days allowed are set to the account<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> of sickness, bad weather,
awkwardness, and slackness. Truly a liberal margin to allow for waste.
It cannot have been easy to farm at a profit with slave-labour on
such terms; for the slave’s necessary upkeep was, however meagre, a
continual charge.</p>

<p>And yet we do not find Varro suggesting that free wage-earning
labour might in the long run prove more economical than slave-labour
even for rough work. Nay more, he does not refer to the employment
of contractors with their several gangs, each interested in getting his
particular job done quickly and the price paid. He only refers to
<i>mercennarii</i> in general terms, as we saw above. Nor does he speak<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> of
<i>politio</i> as a special process, as Cato does. It may be that he did not
think it worth while to enter into these topics. But it is more probable
that the results of agrarian legislation and civil warfare in the revolutionary
period had affected the problems of rustic labour. The attempt
to revive by law the class of small cultivating owners had been a failure.
Military service as a career had competed with rustic wage-earning.
Men waiting to be hired as farm hands were probably scarce. Otherwise,
how can we account for the great armies raised in those days? To refer
once more to a point mentioned above, Varro does not suggest that
the charge of an estate might with advantage be entrusted to a freeman
as <i>vilicus</i>. That we can discover all the reasons for the preference of
slaves as stewards is too much to hope for. That it seemed to be a
guarantee of honesty and devotion to duty, the manager being wholly
in his master’s power, is a fairly certain guess. And yet Varro like
others saw the advisability of employing free labour for occasional
work of importance. Perhaps the permanent nature of a steward’s
responsibilities had something to do with the preference. It may well
have been difficult to keep a hold on a free manager. In management
of a slave staff no small tact and intelligence were needed as well as a
thorough knowledge of farming. General experience needed to be
supplemented by an intimate knowledge<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> of the conditions of the neighbourhood
and the capacities of the particular estate. And a free citizen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
whose abilities and energy might qualify him for management of a big
landed estate, had endless opportunities of turning his qualities to his
own profit elsewhere. Whether as individuals or in companies, enterprising
Romans found lucrative openings in the farming of revenues, in
state-contracts, in commerce, or in money-lending, both in Italy and
in the Provinces. Such employments, compared with a possible estate-stewardship,
would offer greater personal independence and a prospect
of larger gains. And freemen of a baser and less effective type would
have been worse than useless: certainly far inferior to well-chosen
slaves.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">XXVI. CICERO.</h3>

<p>It is hardly possible to avoid devoting a special section to the evidence
of <b>Cicero</b>, though it must consist mainly of noting a number of
isolated references to particular points. With all his many country-houses,
his interest in agriculture was slight. But his active part in public
life of all kinds makes him a necessary witness in any inquiry into the
facts and feelings of his time; though there are few witnesses whose
evidence needs to be received with more caution, particularly in matters
that offer opportunity for partisanship. For our present purpose this
defect does not matter very much. It is chiefly as confirming the statements
of others that his utterances will be cited.</p>

<p>When we reflect that Cicero was himself a man of generous instincts,
and that he was well read in the later Greek philosophies, we are tempted
to expect from him a cosmopolitan attitude on all questions affecting
individuals. He might well look at human rights from the point of
view of common humanity, differentiated solely by personal virtues
and vices and unaffected by the accident of freedom or servitude. But
we do not find him doing this. He might, and did, feel attracted by
the lofty nobility of the Stoic system; but he could not become a Stoic.
No doubt that system could be more or less adapted to the conditions
of Roman life: it was not necessary to make the Stoic principles ridiculous
by carrying<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> priggishness to the verge of caricature. But the
notion that no fundamental difference existed between races and classes,
that for instance the Wise Man, human nature’s masterpiece, might be
found among slaves, was more than Cicero or indeed any level-headed
Roman could digest. The imperial pride of a great people, conscious
of present predominance through past merit, could not sincerely accept
such views. To a Roman the corollary of accepting them would be the
endeavour (more or less successful) to act upon them. This he had no
intention of doing, and a mere theoretical assent<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> to them as philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
speculations was a detail of no serious importance. Taking
this as a rough sketch of the position occupied by Romans of social
and political standing, we must add to it something more to cover the
case of Cicero. He was a ‘new man.’ He was not a great soldier. He
was not a revolutionary demagogue. He was ambitious. In order to
rise and take his place among the Roman nobles he had to fall in with
the sentiments prevailing among them: the newly-risen man could not
afford to leave the smallest doubt as to his devotion to the privileges
of his race and class. Thus, if there was a man in Rome peculiarly tied
to principles of human inequality, it was Cicero.</p>

<p>Therefore we need not be surprised to find that this quick-witted
and warm-hearted man looked upon those engaged in handwork with
a genial contempt<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> sometimes touched with pity. To him, as to the
society in which he moved, bodily labour seemed to deaden interest<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
in higher things, in fact to produce a moral and mental degradation.
In the case of slaves, whose compulsory toil secured to their owners
the wealth and leisure needed (and by some employed) for politics or
self-cultivation, the sacrifice of one human being for the benefit of
another was an appliance of civilization accepted and approved from
time immemorial. But the position of the freeman working for wages,
particularly of the man who lived by letting out his bodily strength<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
to an employer for money, was hardly less degrading in the eyes of
Roman society, and therefore in those of Cicero. We have no description
of the Roman mob by one of themselves. That the rough element<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>
was considerable, and ready to bear a hand in political disorder, is
certain. But they were what circumstances had made them, and it is
probable that the riotous party gangs of Cicero’s time were not usually
recruited among the best of the wage-earners. It is clear that many
slaves took part in riots, and no doubt a number of freedmen also.
In many rural districts disputes between neighbours easily developed
into acts of force and the slaves of rival claimants did battle for their
several owners. Moreover, slaves might belong, not to an individual,
but to a company<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> exploiting some state concession of mineral or other
rights. In such cases ‘regrettable incidents’ were always possible. And
the wild herdsmen (<i>pastores</i>) roaming armed in the lonely hill-country
were a ready-made soldiery ever inclined to brigandage or servile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
rebellions, a notorious danger. It was an age of violence in city and
country. Rich politicians at last took to keeping private bands<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> of
swordsmen (<i>gladiatores</i>). And it is to be borne in mind that, while a
citizen might be unwilling to risk the life of a costly<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> slave, his own
property, a slave would feel no economic restraint to deter him from
killing his master’s citizen enemy.</p>

<p>The employment of slaves in the affrays that took place in country
districts over questions of disputed right is fully illustrated in the
speeches<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> delivered in cases of private law. The fact was openly
recognized in the legal remedies provided, for instance in the various
<i>interdicta</i> framed to facilitate the trial and settlement of disputes as to
<i>possessio</i>. The forms contemplated the probability of slaves being engaged
in assailing or defending possession on behalf of their masters,
and the wording even varied according as the force in question had been
used by men armed or unarmed. Counsel of course made much or little
of the happenings in each case according to the interest of their clients.
But that bloodshed occurred at times in these fights is certain. And
there was no regular police force to keep order in remote corners of
the land. When slaves were once armed and set to fight, they would
soon get out of hand, and a slaveowner might easily lose valuable men.
Nay more, an epidemic of local brigandage might result, particularly
in a time of civil war and general unrest, and none could tell where
the mischief would end. We can only form some slight notion of the
effect of such conditions as these on the prospects of peaceful agriculture.
The speech <i>pro Quinctio</i> belongs to 81 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, the <i>pro Tullio</i>
to 71, the <i>pro Caecina</i> to 69. When we reflect that the slave rising
under Spartacus lasted from 73 to 71, and swept over a large part
of Italy, we may fairly conclude that this period was a bad one for
farming.</p>

<p>The most striking picture of the violence sometimes used in the
disputes of rustic life meets us in the mutilated speech <i>pro Tullio</i>, of
which enough remains to make clear all that concerns us. First, the
form of action employed in the case was one of recent<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> origin, devised
to check the outrages committed by bands of armed slaves, which had
increased since the disturbances of the first civil war. The need for
such a legal remedy must have been peculiarly obvious at the time of
the trial, for the rising of Spartacus had only just been suppressed.
Cicero refers to the notorious scandal of murders committed by these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
armed bands, a danger to individuals and even to the state, that had
led to the creation of the new form of action at law. In stating the
facts of the case, of course from his client’s point of view, he gives us
details<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> which, true or not, were at least such as would not seem incredible
to a Roman court. Tullius owned an estate in southern Italy.
That his title to it was good is taken for granted. But in it was reckoned
a certain parcel of land which had been in undisputed possession of
his father. This strip, which was so situated as to form a convenient
adjunct to a neighbouring estate, was the cause of trouble. The neighbouring
estate had been bought by two partners, who had paid a fancy
price for it. The bargain was a bad one, for the land proved to be
derelict and the farmsteads all burnt down. One of the partners induced
the other to buy him out. In stating the area of the property he included
the border strip of land claimed by Tullius as his own. In the process of
settlement of boundaries for the transfer to the new sole owner he would
have included the disputed ground, but Tullius instructed<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> his attorney
and his steward to prevent this: they evidently did so, and thus the ownership
of the border strip was left to be determined by process of law.
The sequel was characteristic of the times. The thwarted claimant
armed a band of slaves and took possession<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> of the land by force, killing
the slaves who were in occupation on behalf of Tullius, and committing
other murders and acts of brigandage by the way. We need not follow
the case into the law-court. What concerns us is the evidence of unfortunate
land speculation, of land-grabbing, of boundary-disputes, and
of the prompt use of violence to supersede or hamper the legal determination
of rights. The colouring and exaggeration of counsel is to be
allowed for; but we can hardly reject the main outlines of the picture
of armed slave-bands and bloodshed as a rural phenomenon of the
sorely tried South of Italy.</p>

<p>The speech <i>pro Caecina</i> shews us the same state of things existing
in Etruria. The armed violence alleged in this case is milder in form:
at least the one party fled, and nobody was killed. Proceedings were
taken under a possessory interdict issued by a praetor, and Cicero’s
artful pleading is largely occupied with discussion of the bearing and
effect of the particular formula employed. Several interesting transactions<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>
are referred to. A man invests his wife’s dowry in a farm, land
being cheap, owing to bad times, probably the result of the Sullan civil
war. Some time after, he bought some adjoining land for himself.
After his death and that of his direct heir, the estate had to be liquidated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
for purpose of division among legatees. His widow, advised to buy in
the parcel of land adjoining her own farm, employed as agent a man
who had ingratiated himself with her. Under this commission the land
was bought. Cicero declares that it was bought for the widow, who
paid the price, took possession, let it to a tenant, and held it till her
death. She left her second husband Caecina heir to nearly all her
property, and it was between him and the agent Aebutius that troubles
now arose. For Aebutius declared that the land had been bought by
him for himself, and that the lady had only enjoyed the profits of it
for life in usufruct under her first husband’s will. This was legally
quite possible. At the same time he suggested that Caecina had lost
the legal capacity of taking the succession at all. For Sulla had
degraded the citizens belonging to Volaterrae, of whom Caecina was
one. Cicero is more successful in dealing with this side-issue than in
establishing his client’s claim to the land. The dispute arising out of
that claim, the armed violence used by Aebutius to defeat Caecina’s
attempt to assert possession, and the interdict granted to Caecina, were
the stages by which the case came into court. Its merits are not certain.
But the greedy characters on both sides, the trickery employed by one
side or other (perhaps both), and the artful handling of the depositions
of witnesses, may incline the reader to believe that the great orator had
but a poor case. At all events farming in Etruria appears as bound up
with slave labour and as liable to be disturbed by the violence of slaves
in arms.</p>

<p>In the above cases it suited Cicero’s purpose to lay stress on the
perils that beset defenceless persons who were interested in farms in
out-of-the-way<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> places. Yet the use of armed force was probably most
habitual on the waste uplands, and his references to the lawless doings
of the brigand slave-bands fully confirm the warnings of Varro. His
tone varies according to the requirements of his client’s case, but he has
to admit<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> that wayfarers were murdered and bloody affrays between
rival bands ever liable to occur. He can on occasion<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> boldly charge a
political opponent with deliberate reliance on such forces for revolutionary
ends. Thus of C Antonius he asserts ‘he has sold all his live
stock and as good as parted with his open pastures, but he is keeping
his herdsmen; and he boasts that he can mobilize these and start a
slave-rebellion whenever he chooses.’ There was no point in saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
this if it had been absurdly incredible. Another glimpse of the utter
lawlessness prevalent in the wilds appears in the story<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> of murders
committed in Bruttium. Suspicion rested on the slaves employed by
the company who were exploiting the pitch-works in the great forest
of Sila under lease from the state. Even some of the free agents of the
company were suspected. The case, which was dealt with by a special
criminal tribunal, belongs to the year 138 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, and attests the long
standing of such disorders. And it is suggestive of guilty complicity
on the part of the lessees that, though they eventually secured an
acquittal, it was only after extraordinary exertions on the part of their
counsel.</p>

<p>Indeed these great gangs of slaves in the service of <i>publicani</i> were
in many parts of Italy and the Provinces a serious nuisance. Wherever
the exploitation of state properties or the collection of dues was farmed
out to contractors, a number of underlings would be needed. The lower
grades were slaves: a few rose to higher posts as freedmen of the various
companies. Now some of the enterprises, such as mines quarries
woodlands and the collection of grazing dues on the public pastures,
were generally in direct contact with rural life, and employed large
staffs of slaves. The managers of a company were concerned to produce
a high dividend for their shareholders: so long as this resulted from
the labours of their men, it was a matter of indifference to them whether
neighbouring farmers were robbed or otherwise annoyed. That we hear
little or nothing of such annoyances is probably owing to the practice
of locking up slave-labourers at night in an <i>ergastulum</i>, for fear of their
running away, not to keep them from doing damage. Runaways do
not appear singly as a rustic pest. But in bands there was no limit to
the harm that <i>fugitivi</i> might do; witness the horrors of the slave-wars.
In short, wherever slaves were employed in large numbers, the possibility
of violence was never remote. Their masters had always at hand a
force of men, selected for bodily strength and hardened by labour, men
with nothing but hopeless lives to lose, and nothing loth to exchange
dreary toil for the dangers of a fight in which something to their advantage
might turn up. No doubt the instances of slaves called to
arms in rustic disputes were far more numerous than those referred to
by Cicero: he only speaks of those with which he was at the moment
concerned.</p>

<p>Is it then true that in the revolutionary period farming depended
on slave-labour while its security was ever menaced by dangers that
arose directly out of the slave-system? I fear it is true, absurd though
the situation may seem to us. Between the great crises of disturbance
were spells of comparative quiet, in which men could and did farm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
profitably in the chief agricultural districts of Italy. But it must be
remembered that many an estate changed hands in consequence of
civil war, and that many new landlords profited economically by appropriating
the capital sunk in farms by their predecessors. The case
of Sextus Roscius of Ameria gives us some light on this point. The
picture drawn<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> by Cicero of the large landed estate of the elder Roscius,
of his wealth and interest in agriculture, of his jealous and malignant
relatives, of the reasons why he kept his son Sextus tied to a rustic life,
is undoubtedly full of colouring and subtle perversions of fact. Let it
go for what it may be worth. The accused was acquitted of the crime
laid to his charge (parricide), but there is no sign that he was ever able
to recover the estate and the home from which his persecutors had
driven him. They had shared the plunder with Chrysogonus the
favoured freedman of Sulla, who himself bought the bulk of the property
at a mere fraction of its market value, and it is practically certain that
the rogues kept what they got. It was easy to make agriculture pay on
such terms. But what of the former owners of such properties, on whose
ruin the new men’s prosperity was built? Can we believe that genuine
agricultural enterprise was encouraged by a state of things in which the
fruits of long patience and skill were liable to sudden confiscation?</p>

<p>In Cicero, as in other writers, we find evidence of a wage-earning
class living by bodily labour alongside of the slave-population. But
in passages where he speaks<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> of <i>mercennarii</i> it is often uncertain
whether freemen serving for hire, or slaves hired from another owner,
are meant. In his language the associations<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> of the word are mean.
It is true that you may buy for money not only the day’s-work (<i>operae</i>)
of unskilled labourers but the skill (<i>artes</i>) of craftsmen. In the latter
case even Roman self-complacency will admit a certain dignity; for
men of a certain social status<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> such professions are all very well. But
the mere ‘hand’ is the normal instance; and for the time of his employment
he is not easily distinguished from a slave. Therefore Cicero
approves<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> a Stoic precept, that justice bids you to treat slaves as you
would hirelings—don’t stint their allowances (food etc), but get your
day’s-work out of them. In passages<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> where the word <i>mercennarius</i> is
not used, but implied, there is the same tone of contempt, and it is not
always clear whether the workers are free or slaves. In short the word
is not as neutral as <i>operarius</i>, which connotes mere manual labour,
whether the labourer be free or not, and is figuratively used<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> to connote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
a merely mechanical proficiency in any art. Our ‘journeyman’ is
sometimes similarly used.</p>

<p>There are other terms in connexion with land-management the use
of which by Cicero is worth noting. Thus a landlord may have some
order to give in reference to the cultivation of a farm. If he gives it
to his <i>procurator</i><a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>, it is as an instruction, a commission authorizing him
to act; if to his <i>vilicus</i>, it is simply a command. For the former is a
free attorney, able at need to represent his principal even in a court of
law: the latter is a slave steward, the property of his master. The <i>procurator</i>
is hardly a ‘manager’: he seldom occurs in connexion with
agriculture, and seems then to be only required when the principal is
a very ‘big man,’ owning land on a large scale, and probably in scattered
blocks. In such cases it would be convenient for (say) a senator
to give a sort of ‘power of attorney’ to an agent and let him supervise
the direction of a number of farms, each managed by a steward. I take
this policy to be just that against which the writers on agriculture
warn their readers. It sins against the golden rule, that nothing is a
substitute for the Master’s eye. Whether the agent referred to in the
speech <i>pro Tullio</i>, who as well as the steward received<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> written instructions
from Tullius, was guilty of any neglect or blunder, we cannot
tell. That any act done to a <i>procurator</i> or by him was legally equivalent
to the same done to or by his principal, is a point pressed in the <i>pro
Caecina</i>, no doubt because it was safe ground and an excuse for not
dwelling on weak points in a doubtful case.</p>

<p>The <i>colonus</i> as a tenant<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> farmer, whom we find mentioned in Varro
but not in Cato, appears in Cicero. In the <i>pro Caecina</i> we read<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> that
the widow lady took possession of the farm and let it (<i>locavit</i>); also
that the tenant was after her death still occupying the farm, and that
a visit of Caecina, in which he audited the accounts of the tenant, is a
proof that Caecina himself was now in possession. That is, by asserting
control of the sitting tenant Caecina made the man his agent so far as
to retain possession through the presence of his representative. If the
facts were as Cicero states them, the contention would be legally sound.
For, as he points out in another passage, any representative<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> will serve
for these purposes of keeping or losing possession. If the interdict-formula
only says ‘attorney’ (<i>procurator</i>), this does not mean that only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
an attorney in the technical sense, a plenipotentiary agent appointed
by an absentee principal with full legal formalities, is contemplated.
No, the brief formula covers agency of any kind: it will apply to your
tenant your neighbour your client or your freedman, in short to any
person acting on your behalf. In the great indictment of Verres<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> we
find a good instance of tenancy in Sicily, where it seems to have been
customary for large blocks of land to be held on lease from the state
by tenants-in-chief (<i>aratores</i>) who sometimes sublet parcels to <i>coloni</i>.
In this case the trouble arose out of the tithe to which the land was
liable. Verres, in order to squeeze an iniquitous amount out of a
certain farm, appointed a corrupt court charged to inquire whether the
(arable) acreage had been correctly returned by the <i>colonus</i>. Of course
they were instructed to find that the area had been fraudulently understated.
But the person against whom judgment was to be given was
not the <i>colonus</i>, but Xeno, who was not the owner of the farm. He
pleaded that it belonged to his wife, who managed her own affairs;
also that he had not been responsible for the cultivation (<i>non arasse</i>).
Nevertheless he was not only compelled to pay a large sum of money
to meet the unfair damages exacted, but subjected to further extortion
under threat of corporal punishment. The returns on which
the tithes were assessed would seem to have been required from the
actual cultivators, and the lessees of the year’s tithe to have had a
right of action against the owners or chief-tenants of the land, if the
tenant farmer defaulted in any particular. So far we are able to
gather that tenant farmers were no exception at this time, though
perhaps not a numerous class; and that they were not persons of
much social importance. That they were to a considerable extent
dependent on their landlords is probable, though not actually attested
by Cicero, for we have seen evidence of it in a passage of Caesar.
Cicero’s reference<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> to the case of a lady who committed adultery with
a <i>colonus</i> is couched in such terms as to imply the man’s social inferiority.
In another passage<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> we hear of a man in the Order of <i>equites equo
publico</i> being disgraced by a censor taking away his state-horse, and
of his friends crying out in protest that he was <i>optimus colonus</i>, thrifty
and unassuming. Here we have a person of higher social quality, no
doubt: but I conceive <i>colonus</i> to be used in the original sense of
‘cultivator.’ To say ‘he is a good farmer’ does not imply that he is a
mere tenant, any more than it does in the notable passage of Cato.</p>

<p>The <i>vilicus</i> generally appears in Cicero as the slave steward familiar
to us from other writers. In one place<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> he is contrasted with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
<i>dispensator</i>, who seems to be a sort of slave clerk charged with registering
stores and serving out rations clothing etc. As this functionary seldom
meets us in the rustic system of the period, we may perhaps infer that
only large estates, where the <i>vilicus</i> had no time to spare from purely
agricultural duties, required such extra service. In saying that he can
read and write (<i>litteras scit</i>) Cicero may seem to imply that this is not
to be expected from the <i>vilicus</i>: but the inference is not certain, for
the agricultural writers require stewards to read at least. In another
passage<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> we read that in choosing a slave for the post of steward the
one thing to be kept in view is not technical skill but the moral
qualities, honesty industry alertness. Here it is plain that the orator
is warping the truth in order to suit his argument: Varro would never
have disregarded technical skill. For Cicero’s point is that what the
state needs most in its ‘stewards’ (that is, magistrates) is good moral
qualities. On the same lines he had some 16 years before compared<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
Verres to a bad steward, who has ruined his master’s farm by dishonest
and wasteful management, and is in a fair way to be severely punished
for his offence. The tone of this passage is exactly that of old Cato,
put in the rhetorical manner of an advocate.</p>

<p>A few words must be said on the subject of manumission. In his
defence of Rabirius, accused of high treason, Cicero launches<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> out into
a burst of indignation at the attempted revival of an obsolete barbarous
procedure designed for his client’s destruction. The cruel method of
execution to which it points, long disused, is repugnant to Roman
sentiment, utterly inconsistent with the rights of free humanity. Such
a prospect<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> would be quite unendurable even to slaves, unless they
had before them the hope of freedom. For, as he adds below, when
we manumit a slave, he is at once freed thereby from fear of any such
penalties as these. Taken by itself, this passage is better evidence of
the liability of slaves to cruel punishment than of the frequent use of
manumission. But we know from Cicero’s letters and from other sources
that freedmen were numerous. And from a sentence<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> in one of the
<i>Philippics</i> we may gather that it was not unusual for masters to grant
freedom to slaves after six years of honest and painstaking service. I
suspect that this utterance, in the context in which it occurs, should not
be taken too literally. That Romans of wealth and position liked to surround
themselves with retainers, humble and loyal, bound to their patron
by ties of gratitude and interest, is certain: and early manumissions
were naturally promoted by this motive. But the most pleasing instances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
were of course those in which a community of pursuits developed a
real sympathy, even affection between owner and owned, as in the
case of Tiro, on whose manumission<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> Quintus Cicero wrote to congratulate
his brother. In all these passages, however, there is one
thing to be noted. They do not look to the conditions of rustic life;
and, so far as the evidence of Cicero goes, they do not shake my conviction
that manumission was a very rare event on country estates.</p>

<p>A topic of special interest is the evidence of the existence of farmers
who, whether employing slaves or not, worked on the land in person.
What does Cicero say as to αὐτουργία, in his time? It has been pointed
out above that, when it suits his present purpose, he not only enlarges
on the homely virtues of country folk but refers to the old Roman
tradition of farmer-citizens called from the plough to guide and save
the state in hours of danger. He made full use of this topic in his
defence of Sextus Roscius, and represented his client as a simple rustic,
reeking of the farmyard,—how far truly, is doubtful. But he does not
go so far as to depict him ploughing or digging or carting manure. It
is reasonable to suppose that the slaves to whom he refers<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> did the
rough farm-work under his orders. When he can make capital out of
the wrongs of the humble labouring farmer, the orator does not shrink
from doing so. One of the iniquities laid to the charge<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> of Verres is
that he shifted the burden of taking legal proceedings from the lessees
of the Sicilian tithes (<i>decumani</i>) to the tithe-liable lessees of the land
(the <i>aratores</i>). Instead of the tithe-farmer having to prove that his
demand was just, the land-farmer had to prove that it was unjust.
Now this was too much even for those farming on a large scale: it
meant in practice that they had to leave their farms and go off to make
their appeals at Syracuse. But the hardship was far greater in the case
of small farmers (probably sub-tenants), of whom he speaks thus:
‘And what of those whose means of tillage<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> consist of one yoke of
oxen, who labour on their farms with their own hands—in the days
before your governorship such men were a very numerous class in
Sicily—when they have satisfied the demands of Apronius, what are
they to do next? Are they to leave their tillages, leave their house
and home, and come to Syracuse, in the hope of reasserting their rights
at law against an Apronius<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> under the impartial government of a
Verres?’ No doubt the most is made of these poor men and their
wrongs. But we need not doubt that there were still some small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
working farmers in Sicily. In the half-century or so before the time
of Verres we hear<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> of free Sicilians who were sorely disturbed by the
great servile rebellions and even driven to make common cause with
the insurgent slaves. Some such ‘small men’ were evidently still to
be found wedged in among the big plantations.</p>

<p>Another important passage occurs in the artful speech against the
agrarian bill of Rullus. It refers to the <i>ager Campanus</i>, on the value
of which as a public asset<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Cicero insists. This exceptionally fertile
district was, and had long been, let by the state to cultivating tenants,
whose regularly-paid rents were one of the safest items in the Roman
budget. These farms were no <i>latifundia</i>, but apparently of moderate
size, such that thrifty farmers could make a good living in this favoured
land. With the various political<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> changes, carrying with them disturbances
of occupancy, caused by wars in the past, we are not here
concerned. Cicero declares that one aim of the bill was the assignation
of this district to new freeholders, which meant that the state treasury
would lose a sure source of revenue. This, in the interest of the aristocratic
party, he was opposing, and undoubtedly misrepresented facts
whenever it suited his purpose. In matters of this kind, he says, the
cry is often raised<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> that it is not right for lands to lie depopulated
with no freemen left to till them. This no doubt refers to the Gracchan
programme for revival of the peasant farmers. Cicero declares that
such a cry is irrelevant to the present issue, for the effect of the bill
will be to turn out the excellent sitting tenants<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> only to make room
for new men, the dependants and tools of a political clique. The reason
why, after the fall of Capua in the second Punic war, that city was
deprived of all corporate existence, and yet the houses were left standing,
was this: the menace of a disloyal Capua had to be removed, but
a town-centre of some sort could not be dispensed with. For marketing,
for storage<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> of produce, the farmers must have some place of
common resort: and when weary with working on their farms they
would find the town homesteads a welcome accommodation. Allowing
for rhetorical colouring in the interests of his case, perhaps we may
take it from Cicero that a fair number of practical working farmers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
were settled on the Campanian plain. His prediction<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> that, if this
district were to be distributed in freehold allotments, it would presently
pass into the hands of a few wealthy proprietors (as the Sullan allotments
had been doing) suggests a certain degree of sincerity. But
taken as a whole the utterances of Cicero are too general, and too
obviously meant to serve a temporary purpose, to furnish trustworthy
data for estimating the numerical strength and importance of the
working farmers in the Italy of his day.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">XXVII. SALLUST AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p>In the writings of Cicero’s contemporaries other than Varro there
is very little to be found bearing upon rustic life and labour as it went
on in their time. Literature was occupied with other themes appropriate
to the political conflicts or social scandals or philosophic questionings
that chiefly interested various individuals and the circles in which they
moved. The origins of civilization formed a fascinating problem for
some, for instance the Epicurean <b>Lucretius</b>: but his theory of the
development of agriculture deals with matters outside of our subject.
The one helpful passage of <b>Caesar</b><a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> has been noticed already. So too
has the contemptuous reference<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> of <b>Sallust</b> to agriculture as slaves’
work. This writer in a few places touches on points of interest. For
instance, in speaking<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> of the various classes of men who were ripe for
revolution, he says ‘moreover there were the able-bodied men who
had been used to earn a hard living as hired labourers on farms; the
attraction of private and public bounties had drawn them into Rome,
where they found idle leisure preferable to thankless toil.’ Such statements,
unsupported by statistics, must be received with caution, but
this assertion is so far backed up by what we learn from other sources,
that we can accept it as evidence. How many such rustic immigrants
of this class there were at any given moment, is what we want to
know, and do not. Again, in a passage<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> describing the popularity of
Marius in 108 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, he says ‘in short, the commons were fired with such
enthusiasm that the handworkers and the rustics of all sorts, men
whose means and credit consisted in the labour of their hands, struck
work and attended Marius in crowds, putting his election before their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
own daily needs.’ In this there is perhaps some exaggeration, but the
picture is probably true in the main. The <i>agrestes</i> may include both
small farmers and labourers. But they can hardly have come from
great distances, and so were probably not very numerous. The description
is as loose as passages of the kind were in ancient writers, and are
still. The references to rustic slave-gangs, and Catiline’s refusal to arm
them in support of his rising, have been cited above.</p>

<p>We now pass into the period in which the last acts of the Roman
Republican drama were played and the great senatorial aristocrats, in
whose hands was a great share of the best lands in Italy, lost the
power to exploit the subject world. Not only by official extortion in
provincial governorships, but by money-lending at usurious interest<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
to client princes or provincial cities, these greedy nobles amassed great
sums of money, some of which was employed in political corruption
to secure control of government at home. Civil wars and proscriptions
now thinned their ranks, and confiscations threw many estates into
the market. The fall of Antony in 31 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> left Octavian master of the
whole empire of Rome, an emperor ruling under republican disguises.
Now it was naturally and properly his aim to neutralize the effects of
past disorders and remove their causes. He looked back to the traditions
of Roman growth and glory, and hoped by using the lessons thus
learnt to revive Roman prosperity and find a sound basis for imperial
strength. He worked on many lines: that which concerns us here is
his policy towards rustic life and agriculture. As he persuaded and
pressed the rich to be less selfish<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and more public-spirited, to spend
less on ostentation and the adornment of their mansions and parks,
and to contribute liberally to works of public magnificence or utility,
a duty now long neglected; even so he strove to rebuild Italian farming,
to make it what it had been of yore, the seed-bed of simple civic
and military virtues. But ancient civilization, in the course of its
development in the Roman empire, had now gone too far for any ruler,
however well-meaning and powerful, to turn the tide. Socially it was
too concentrated and urban, economically too individualistic and too
dependent on the manipulation of masses of capital. In many directions
the policy of the judicious emperor was marvellously successful: but
he did not succeed in reviving agriculture on the old traditional footing
as a nursery of peasant farmers. He sought to bring back a traditional
golden age, and court-poets were willing to assert<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> that the golden
age had indeed returned. This was not true. The ever-repeated praises
of country life are unreal. Even when sincere, they are the voice of
town-bred men, weary of the fuss and follies of urban life, to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
nevertheless they would presently come back refreshed but bored<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>
with their rural holiday. That the science and art of agriculture were
being improved, is true; hence the treatise of Varro, written in his old
age. But technical improvements could not set the small farmers as a
class on their legs again. The small man’s vantage lay (and still lies)
in minute care and labour freely bestowed, without stopping to inquire
whether the percentage of profit is or is not an adequate return for his
toil. Moreover, technical improvements often require the command
of considerable capital. The big man can sink capital and await a
return on the investment: but this return must be at a minimum rate
or he will feel that it does not ‘pay.’ For in his calculations he cannot
help comparing the returns<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> on different kinds of investments.</p>

<p>Under such conditions it is no wonder that we find <i>latifundia</i> still
existing under the early Empire in districts suited for the plantation
system. No doubt much of the large landholding was the outcome of
social ambitions. Men who had taken advantage of civil war and its
sequels to sink money in land took their profit either in a good percentage
on plantations, or in the enhanced importance gained by
owning fine country places, or in both ways. A new class was coming
to the front under the imperial régime and among them were wealthy
freedmen. These had not yet reached the predominant influence and
colossal wealth that marked their successors of the next generation.
But they had begun to appear<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> in the last age of the Republic, and
were now a force by no means to be ignored. Such landowners were
not likely to favour the revival of peasant farmers, unless the presence
of the latter could be utilized in the interest of the big estates. There
were two ways in which this result could be attained. A small freeholder
might, from the small size of his farm, have some spare time,
and be willing to turn it to account by working elsewhere for wages.
Such a man would be a labourer of the very best kind, but he could
not be relied upon to be disengaged at a particular moment; for, if
not busy just then on his own farm, some other employer might have
secured his services. A small tenant farmer, to whom part of a great
estate was let, would be governed by any conditions agreed upon between
him and his landlord. That these conditions might include a
liability to a certain amount of actual service at certain seasons on his
landlord’s estate, is obvious. That the <i>coloni</i> of later times were normally
in this position, is well known. That this system, under which
a tenant retaining personal freedom was practically (and at length
legally) bound to the soil, suddenly arose and became effective, is most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
improbable. Whether we can detect any signs of its gradual introduction
will appear as our inquiry proceeds. We have already noted the few
references to tenant <i>coloni</i> under the Republic. It is enough to remark
here that, whatever degree of improvement in agriculture may have
taken place owing to the reestablishment of peace and order, it could
hardly have been brought about without employing the best labour
to be had. If therefore we find reason to believe that the supply of
skilled free labour for special agricultural work was gradually found
by giving a new turn to the tenancy-system, we may hazard a guess
that the first tentative steps in this direction belong to the quiet developments
of the Augustan peace.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">XXVIII. AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURAL LABOUR UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE.
GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>That the position of the working farmer in the fourth and fifth
centuries <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> was very different from what it had been in the early
days of the Roman Republic, is hardly open to question. That in the
last two centuries of the Republic his position had been gravely altered
for the worse in a large (and that in general the best) part of Italy, is
not less certain. This period, from 241 to 31 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, had seen the subjection
to Rome of the Mediterranean countries, and the Italian peninsula
was an imperial land. It was inevitable that from a dominion so vast
and various there should be some sort of reaction on its mistress, and
reaction there had been, mostly for evil, on the victorious Roman
state. The political social and moral effects of this reaction do not
concern us here save only in so far as the economic situation was
affected thereby. For instance, the plunder of the Provinces by bad
governors and the extortions practised by subordinate officials, the greed
of financiers and their agents, were the chief sources of the immense
sums of money that poured into Italy. The corruption promoted by
all this ill-gotten wealth expressed itself in many forms; but in no
way was it more effective than in degradation of agriculture. It was
not merely that it forwarded the movement towards great aggregations
of <i>latifundia</i>. It supplied the means of controlling politics by bribery
and violence and rendering nugatory all endeavours to reform the
land-system and give legislative remedies a fair trial. The events of
the revolutionary period left nearly all the land of Italy in private
ownership, most of it in the hands of large owners. The Sullan and
Triumviral confiscations and assignations were social calamities and
economic failures. Of their paralysing effect on agriculture we can
only form a general notion, but it is clear that no revival of a free farming
peasantry took place.</p>

<p>Changes there had been in agriculture, due to influences from
abroad. Farming on a large scale and organization of slave labour had
given it an industrial turn. The crude and brutal form in which this
at first appeared had probably been somewhat modified by experience.
The great plantations clumsily adapted from Punic models were not
easily made to pay. More variety in crops became the fashion, and
the specializing of labour more necessary. In this we may surely trace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
Greek and Greco-oriental influences, and the advance in this respect
is reflected in the more scientific precepts of Varro as compared with
those of Cato. But, so long as the industrial aim, the raising of large
crops for the urban market, prevailed, this change could not tend to
revive the farming peasantry, whose aim was primarily an independent
subsistence, and who lacked the capital needed for agricultural enterprise
on industrial lines. Meanwhile there was the large-scale slavery
system firmly established, and nothing less than shrinkage of the
supply of slaves was likely to shake it.</p>

<p>But the course of Roman conquest and formation of Provinces had
brought Italy into contact with countries in which agriculture and its
relation to governments stood on a very different footing from that traditional
in Roman Italy. The independent peasant farmer living by his
own labour on his own land, a double character of citizen and soldier,
untroubled by official interference, was a type not present to the eyes
of Romans as they looked abroad. Tribal ownership, still common in
the West, had been outgrown in Italy. The Carthaginian system, from
which much had been learnt, was an exploitation-system, as industrial
as a government of merchant princes could make it. In Sicily it met a
Hellenistic system set up by the rulers of Syracuse, and the two seem
to have blended or at least to have had common characteristics. The
normal feature was the payment of a tithe of produce (δεκάτη) to the
State. For the State claimed the property of the land, and reserved to
itself a regular 10% in acknowledgement thereof. This royal title had
passed to Rome, and Rome accordingly levied her normal <i>decumae</i>,
exemption from which was a special favour granted to a few communities.
Now the principle that the ultimate ownership of land is
vested in the King<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> was well known in the East, and is to be traced
in several of the monarchies founded by the Successors of Alexander.
In the Seleucid and Attalid kingdoms there have been found indications
of it, though the privileges of cities and temples checked its general
application. But in Egypt it existed in full vigour, and had done so
from time immemorial. It was in fact the most essential expression
of oriental ideas of sovranty. Combined with it was the reservation
of certain areas as peculiarly ‘royal lands’ the cultivators of which
were ‘royal farmers,’ βασιλικοὶ γεωργοί, standing in a direct relation
to the King and controlled by his administrative officials. The interest
of the sovran was to extract a regular revenue from the crown-lands:
hence it was the aim of government to secure the residence of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
farmers and the continuous cultivation of the soil. The object was
attained by minute regulations applied to a submissive people of small
needs.</p>

<p>It is evident that agriculture under conditions such as these was
based on ideas fundamentally different from those prevalent in Italy.
There private ownership was the rule, and by the end of the Republic
it was so more than ever. The <i>latifundia</i> had grown by transfers
of property<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> in land, whether the holdings so absorbed were original
small freeholds or allotments of state land granted under agrarian laws.
Present estates, whether large or small, were normally held under a full
proprietary title; and the large ones at least were valued as an asset of
social and political importance rather than as a source of economic
profit. The owner could do what he would with his own, and in Italy<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>
there was no tax-burden on his land. We may ask how it came about
that the Italian and Provincial systems stood thus side by side, neither
assimilating the other. The answer is that the contrast suited the interests
of the moneyed classes who controlled the government of Rome.
To exploit the regal conditions taken over by the Republic abroad was
for them a direct road to riches, and the gratification of their ambitions
was achieved by the free employment of their riches at home. The
common herd of poor citizens, pauperized in Rome or scattered in
country towns and hamlets, had no effective means of influencing policy,
even if they understood what was going on and had (which they had
not) an alternative policy of their own. So the Empire took over from
the Republic a system existing for the benefit of hostile aristocrats and
capitalists, with whom it was not practicable to dispense and whom it
was not easy to control.</p>

<p>We cannot suppose that the classes concerned with agriculture had
any suspicion how far-reaching were the changes destined to come
about under the new government. They could not look centuries ahead.
For the present, the ruler spared no pains to dissemble his autocratic
power and pose as a preserver and restorer of the Past. Caution and a
judicious patronage inspired literature to praise the government and
to observe a discreet silence on unwelcome topics. The attitude of
Augustus towards agriculture will be discussed below. Here it is only
necessary to remark that the first aim of his policy in this as in other
departments was to set the machine working with the least possible
appearance of change. As the republican magistracies were left standing,
and gradually failed through the incompetence of senatorial guidance,
so no crude agrarian schemes were allowed to upset existing conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
and development was left to follow the lines of changing economic and
political needs. It is well to take a few important matters and see very
briefly how imperial policy set going tendencies that were in course of
time to affect profoundly the position of agriculture.</p>

<p>In the first place it was clear that no stable reconstruction was
possible without a large and steady income. To this end a great reform
of the old methods of revenue-collection was necessary. The wasteful
system of tax-farmers practically unchecked in their exactions was
exchanged for collection by officials of the state or of municipalities.
In the case of land-revenue this change was especially momentous,
for in no department had the abuses and extortions of <i>publicani</i> been
more oppressive. And it was in the Emperor’s Provinces that this
reform was first achieved. Agriculture was by far the most widespread
occupation of the subject peoples; and the true imperial interest was,
not to squeeze the most possible out of them at a given moment, but
to promote their continuous wellbeing as producers of a moderate but
sure revenue. That this wise policy was deliberately followed is indicated
by the separate<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> treatment of Egypt. Augustus did not present
his new acquisition to the Roman state. He stepped into the position
of the late Ptolemies, and was king there without the name. As he
found the cash of Ptolemaic treasure a means of paying off debts and
avoiding initial bankruptcy, so by keeping up the existing financial
system he enjoyed year by year a large income entirely at his own
disposal, and avoided the risk of disturbing institutions to which the
native farmers had been used from time immemorial. The possession
of this vast private revenue undoubtedly had much to do with the successful
career of Augustus in establishing the empire.</p>

<p>So long as the empire was secure from invasion, and the collection
of taxes on a fair and economical plan afforded sufficient and regular
returns, general prosperity prevailed over a larger area than ever before.
The boon of peace was to the subject peoples a compensation for the
loss of an independence the advantages of which were uncertain and
in most cases probably forgotten. If the benumbing of national feelings
was in itself not a good thing, the central government was able to pay
its way, and emperors could at need appear as a sort of benign providence,
by grants of money or temporary remissions of taxation in relief
of extraordinary calamities. And yet, as we can now see in retrospect,
the establishment of the new monarchy had set in motion tendencies
that were destined to upset the social and economic structure and
eventually to give it a more Oriental character. Italy long remained a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
favoured metropolitan land. But the great landowning nobles no longer
ruled it and the Provinces also. No dissembling could conceal the truth
that their political importance was gone. It may be<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> that some of the
great landlords gave more attention to their estates as economic units.
It is much more certain that large-scale landholding abroad<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> was more
attractive than that in Italy. It was not a new thing, and under the
republican government great provincial Roman landlords had enjoyed
a sort of local autocratic position, assured by their influence in Rome.
But an emperor’s point of view was very different from that of the old
republican Senate. He could not allow the formation of local principalities
in the form of great estates under no effective control. These
landlords had been bitter opponents of Julius Caesar: Augustus had
been driven to make away with some of them: the uneasiness of his
successors at length found full vent in the action of Nero, who put to
death six great landlords in Africa, and confiscated their estates. Half
Africa, the Province specially affected, thus passed into the category
of Imperial Domains, under the control of a departmental bureau,
and later times added more and more to these <i>praedia Caesaris</i> in
many parts of the empire.</p>

<p>The convenient simplicity of having great areas of productive land
administered by imperial agents more or less controlled by the officials
of a central department, into which the yearly dues were regularly paid,
cannot have escaped the notice of emperors. But the advantages of
such a system had been a part of their actual experience<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> from the first
in the case of Egypt. Egypt too was the special home of finance based
on a system of regulated agriculture and hereditary continuity of occupation.
In particular, the interest of the government in the maintenance
and extension of cultivation was expressed in minute rules for land-tenure
and dues payable, and the care taken to keep the class of ‘royal
farmers’ in a prosperous condition. Thus there was recognized a sort
of community of interest between peasant and king. That middlemen
should not oppress the former or defraud the latter was a common
concern of both. Now in the Roman empire we note the growth of a
system resembling this in its chief features. We find the tillage of
imperial domains<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> carried on by small farmers holding parcels of land,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
generally as sub-tenants of tenants-in-chief holding direct from the
emperor. These small farmers were evidently workers, whether they
to some extent used slave-labour or not. Imperial policy favoured
these men as steady producers turning the land to good account, and
thus adding to the resources of the empire without being (like great
landlords) a possible source of danger. Hence great care was taken to
protect the <i>coloni Caesaris</i> from oppression by middlemen: and, so long
as head-tenants and official agents did not corruptly combine to wrong
the farmers, the protection seems to have been effective. Moreover, the
advantage of retaining the same tenants on the land whose conditions
they understood by experience, and of inducing them to reclaim and
improve further portions of the waste, was kept clearly in view. A
policy of official encouragement in these directions was in full swing
in the second century <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> and may perhaps have been initiated by
Vespasian.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to assume that these arrangements were directly
copied from Oriental, particularly Egyptian, conditions. The convenience
of permanent tenants and the ever-pressing need of food-supply are
enough to account for the general aim, and experience of the East
would naturally help to mature the policy. The establishment of the
Empire made it possible. But we must plainly note the significance of
new ideas in respect of residence and cultivation. In the Roman land-system
of Italy private ownership was the rule, and the general
assumption that the owner cultivated on his own account: stewards
and slave-gangs were common but not essential phenomena. It is true
that the practice of letting farms to cultivating tenants existed, and that
in the first two centuries of the Empire it was on the increase, probably
promoted by the comparative scarcity of slaves in times of peace. But
tenancy was a contract-relation, and the law, while protecting the
tenant, gave to the landlord ample means of enforcing regular and
thorough cultivation. And this automatically ensured the tenant’s
residence in any conditions short of final despair. We shall see that as
agriculture declined in Italy it became more and more difficult to find and
keep satisfactory tenants: but the tenant was in the last resort free to go,
and the man who had to be compelled to cultivate properly was just the
man on whom the use of legal remedies was least likely to produce the
desired practical effect. Now on the imperial domains abroad we find
a growing tendency to insist on residence, as a rule imposed from above.
The emperor could not leave his <i>coloni</i> simply at the mercy of his
head-tenants. He was very ready to protect them, but to have them
flitting at will was another matter. And this tendency surely points to
Egyptian analogies; naturally too, as the Empire was becoming more
definitely a Monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>We shall also find reason to think that both in Italy and in the
Provinces there was a tendency to reduce farm-tenants to a considerable
degree of <i>de facto</i> dependence by manipulation of economic relations.
A landlord could let a farm on terms apparently favourable but so
arranged that it was easy for the tenant to fall into arrears and become
his debtor. The exploitation of debtors’ necessities<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> was a practice
traditionally Roman from very early times. True, it was seldom politic
to sell up a defaulting tenant in the declining state of Italian agriculture.
But the gradual acceptance of a liability to small burdens in lieu of
cash payment might rob him of his effective independence before he
was well aware of the change in his position. On a great provincial
domain, the emperor being far away, a head-tenant could deal with the
sub-tenants on much the same lines. A trifling requirement, just exceeding
what was actually due, would be submitted to as not worth
the trouble and risk of setting the appeal-machinery in motion. Further
encroachments, infinitesimal but cumulative, might reduce the <i>colonus</i>
to a semi-servile condition: and, the poorer he became, the less his
prospect of protection from the emperor’s local agents, too often men
of itching palms. Still the <i>coloni</i> were freemen, and we have evidence
that they sometimes appealed to their imperial lord, and with success.
It seems that in some respects <i>coloni Caesaris</i> were at an advantage as
compared with <i>coloni</i> of private landlords, at least in the means of
protection. Roman law was very chary of interference with matters of
private contract, and the principles guiding the courts were well known.
An astute landlord could see to it that his encroachments on a tenant’s
freedom did not entitle the man to a legal remedy. But the imperial
domains abroad were often, if not always, governed by administrative
procedure under the emperor’s own agents; and these gentry could
quickly be brought to order, and compelled to redress grievances, by
a single word from headquarters. That the word was forthcoming on
occasion is not wonderful. The policy of an emperor was to cherish
and encourage the patient farmers whose economic value was a sound
imperial asset, while the head-tenant was only a convenient middleman.
But the private landowner had no imperial interest to guide him, and
looked only to his own immediate profit.</p>

<p>In tracing the influences that changed the condition of the working
farmer we must not forget the establishment of a new military system.
The standing army created by Augustus was an absolute necessity for
imperial defence. At the same time it was a recognition of the fact that
the old system of temporary levies, long proved inadequate, must
henceforth be abandoned. Frontier armies could not be formed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
simply mobilizing free peasants for a campaign. The strength of the
armies lay in military skill, not in numbers. Long service and special
training made them uniformly professional, and provision was duly
made for regular conditions of retirement. The Italian peasant-farmers,
much fewer than of yore, and no longer all potential soldiers, were left
to become simply professional farmers. That agriculture nevertheless
did not really prosper was due to causes beyond their control; but
that they, both tenant <i>coloni</i> and any remaining small owners, should
tend to become a purely peasant class was inevitable. Augustus may
have wished to rebuild Italian agriculture on a sound foundation of the
peasant-elements, but circumstances were too contrary for the successful
prosecution of any such design. Meanwhile the marked differentiation<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>
of soldier and farmer, and the settlement of veterans on allotments of
land, mainly in frontier Provinces, was proceeding. Analogies from the
East, particularly from Egypt, where such arrangements<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> were traditional,
can hardly have been ignored. In ancient Egypt the division of military
and farming classes had been so marked as to present the appearance of
a caste-system. But this was not peculiar to Egypt. It was in full vigour
in ancient India, where it impressed<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> Greek observers, to whom the general
absence of slaves, there as in Egypt, seemed one of its notable phenomena.</p>

<p>I do not venture to suggest that Roman emperors set themselves
deliberately to substitute a fixed attachment of working farmers to the
soil for a failing system of rustic slave-labour. But it is not likely that,
as labour-problems from time to time arose, the well-known Oriental
solutions were without some influence on their policy. We must not
forget that Greek thinkers had long ago approved the plan of strict
differentiation of functions in ideal states, and that such notions, popularized
in Latin, were common property in educated circles. Tradition<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>
even pointed to the existence of some such differentiation in primitive
Rome. Therefore, when we find under the later Empire a rigid system
of castes and gilds, and the <i>coloni</i> attached to the soil with stern
penalties to hinder movement, we must not view the situation with
modern eyes. The restraint, that to us seems a cruel numbing of forces
vital to human progress, would come as no great shock to the world of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the fourth century, long prepared for the step by experience not encountered
by theory. To us it is a painful revolution that, instead of
the land belonging to the cultivator, the cultivator had become an
appendage of the land. But it was the outcome of a long process: as
for progress in any good sense, it had ceased. Government had become
a series of vain expedients to arrest decay. And the rule of fixed <i>origo</i>,
a man’s officially fixed domicile, was nothing more than the doctrine
of the ἰδία long prevalent in the East.</p>

<p>The true significance of the change binding the tiller to the soil he
tilled is to be found in the fact that it was a desperate effort to solve a
labour-question. To secure a sufficient supply of food had been a cause
of anxiety to the imperial government from the first. The encouragement
of increased production had become an important part of imperial
policy in the second century. It looked to the small working farmers
as the chief producing agency, men who provided all or most of the
labour on their farms, and in at least some cases a certain amount of
task-work<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> on the larger farms of the head-tenants. But in the wars
and utter confusion of the third century the strain on the system was
too great. The peaceful and prosperous parts of the empire suffered
from increased demands on their resources to make good the deficiencies
of the Provinces troubled with invasions or rebellions. And there can
be no doubt that the working of governmental departments was interrupted
and impeded by the general disorder. In such times as those
of Gallienus and the so-called Thirty Tyrants the protection of the
small farmers by intervention of the central authority must have been
pitifully ineffective. Naturally enough, we do not get direct record of
this failure, but the change of conditions that followed on the restoration
of order by Diocletian shews what had been happening. The increase
of taxation, rendered necessary by the costly machinery of the new
government, led to increased pressure on the farmers, and evasions had
to be checked by increased restraints. In a few years the facts were
recognized and stereotyped by the law of Constantine, and the <i>coloni</i>
were henceforth bound down to the soil by an act of state. Another
notable change<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> was introduced by requiring payment of dues to be
made in kind. The motive of this was to provide a certain means of
supporting the armies and the elaborate civil service; for the currency,
miserably debased in the course of the third century, was a quite unsuitable
medium for the purpose. That Diocletian, in these institutions
of a new model, was not consciously applying oriental usage to the
empire generally, is hardly credible. It only remained to reduce Italy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
to the common level by subjecting Italian land to taxation. This he
did, and the new Oriental Monarchy was complete.</p>

<p>That a labour-question underlay the policy of attaching the <i>coloni</i>
to the land, is to be gathered from the following considerations. The
development of the plan of promoting small tenancies, particularly on
the imperial domains, was undoubtedly calculated to take the place of
large-scale cultivation by slave labour. It was a move in the direction
of more intensive tillage, and economically sound. So long as a firm
hand was kept on large head-tenants and imperial officials, the plan
seems to have been on the whole a success. But all depended on the
protection of the small working farmers, and of course on the moderation
of government demands. The disorders of the third century
tended to paralyse the protection while they increased demands. Therefore
the head-tenants, aided by the slackness or collusion of officials,
gained a predominant power, which imperial policy had been concerned
to prevent. By the time of Diocletian their position was far stronger than
it had been under Hadrian. To restore the former relations by governmental
action would be certainly difficult, perhaps impossible. As
middlemen, through whose agency the collection of dues in non-municipal
areas could be effected, they were useful. It was a saving
of trouble to deal with a comparatively small number of persons, and
those men of substance. The remodelling of the disordered Empire was
no doubt a complicated and laborious business, and anything that
promised to save trouble would be welcomed. So the government
accepted<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> the changed position as accomplished fact, and left the <i>coloni</i>,
its former clients, to the mercies of the men of capital. But the big
men, controlling ever more lands, whether as possessors or as imperial
head-tenants or as ‘patrons’ of helpless villagers, could not meet their
obligations to the government without having the disposal of a sufficient
and regular supply of labour. And to the authorities of the later Empire,
deeply committed to a rigid system of castes and gilds, no way of
meeting the difficulty seemed open but to extend the system of fixity
to the class of toilers on the land. The motive was a financial one,
naturally. Non-industrial, and so unable to pay for imports by export
of its own manufactures, the civilization of the empire was financially
based upon agriculture. Looking back on the past, we can see that
the deadening of hope and enterprise in the farming population was a
ruinous thing. But the empire drifted into it as the result of circumstances
and influences long operative and eventually irresistible. To displace
the free peasant by the slave, then the slave by the small tenant, only
to end by converting the small tenant into a serf, was a part of the
Roman fate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROMEAUGUSTUS_TO_NERO">ROME—AUGUSTUS TO NERO</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">XXIX. HORACE AND VERGIL.</h3>

<p>For literary evidence bearing on agriculture in the time of Augustus
we naturally look to Vergil and Horace. Now these two witnesses, taken
separately and construed literally, might convey very different, even
inconsistent, impressions of farm life and labour in the world around
them. And Vergil is the central figure of Roman literature, the poet
who absorbed the products of the past and dominated those of many
generations to come. His quality as a witness to the present is what
concerns us here. I have tried to discuss this problem thoroughly and
fairly in a special section. In order to do this, it has been necessary
to deal <i>pari passu</i> with most of the evidence of Horace, the rest of
which can be treated first by itself.</p>

<p><b>Horace</b>, the freedman’s son, himself an illustration of the way in
which the ranks of Roman citizenship were being recruited from foreign
sources, yields to none in his admiration of the rustic Romans of old<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>
and the manly virtues of the genuine stock. In the dialogue between
himself and his slave Davus the latter is made to twit him with his
praises of the simple life and manners of the commons of yore, though
he would never be content to live as they did. A palpable hit, as
Horace knew: but he did not change his tone. With due respect he
speaks of the farmers of olden time, men of sturdy mould and few
wants. It was as poor men on small hereditary farms<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> that M’ Curius
and Camillus grew to be champions of Rome. In those far-off days
the citizen might have little of his own, but the public treasury<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> was
full; a sharp contrast to present selfishness and greedy land-grabbing.
Those old farmer folk put their own hand to the work. Their sons
were brought up to a daily round of heavy tasks, and the mother of
such families<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> was a strict ruler and an active housewife. For the scale
of all their operations was small, and personal labour their chief means
of attaining limited ends. They are not represented as using slave
labour, nor is the omission strange. For the military needs of the
great world-empire were never far from the minds of the Augustan
writers, conscious as they were of their master’s anxieties on this score.
Now the typical peasant of old time was farmer and soldier too, and
it is of the <i>rusticorum mascula militum proles</i> that Horace is thinking.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
There was no need to refer to farm-slaves even in the case of Regulus<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>,
whom tradition evidently assumed to have been a slaveowner. But,
when he refers to circumstances of his own day, the slave meets us
everywhere; not only in urban life and the domestic circle, but on
the farm and in the contractor’s<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> labour-gang. We then hear of great
estates, of great blocks of land mostly forest (<i>saltus</i>)<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> bought up by
the rich, of the sumptuous <i>villae</i> of the new style, all implying masses
of slave labour: also of the great estates outside<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Italy, from which
speculators were already drawing incomes.</p>

<p>Side by side with these scenes of aggressive opulence, we find
occasional mention of a poorer class, farming small holdings, who are
sometimes represented<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> as cultivators of land inherited from their forefathers.
How far we are to take these references literally, that is as
evidence that such persons were ordinary figures in the rustic life of
Italy, may be doubted. The poet in need of material for contrasts,
which are inevitably part of his stock-in-trade, has little in common
with the statistician or even the stolid reporter. Nor can we be sure
that the man who ‘works his paternal farm with oxen of his own’ or
‘delights to cleave his ancestral fields with the mattock,’ are workers
doing the bodily labour in person. Even Horace, inclined though he
is to realism, cannot be trusted so far: such words<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> as <i>arat</i> and
<i>aedificat</i> for instance do not necessarily mean that the man guides the
plough or is his own mason or carpenter. When he speaks of ‘all that
the tireless Apulian<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> ploughs’—that is, the harvests he raises by
ploughing—he does not seem to have in mind the small farmer. For
the context clearly suggests corn raised on a large scale. And yet elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>
he gives us a picture of an Apulian peasant whose hard toil is
cheered and eased by the work and attentions of his sunburnt wife, a
little ideal scene of rural bliss. Apulia is a large district, and not
uniform<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> in character, so we need not assume that either of these
passages misrepresents fact. And there is a noticeable difference between
the style of the Satires and Epistles on the one hand and that
of the Odes on the other. In vocabulary, as in metre and rhythm, the
former enjoy an easy license denied to the severer lyric poems on
which he stakes his strictly poetic reputation. In the Odes<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> for instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
<i>colonus</i> bears the old general sense ‘tiller of the soil’: in the Satires
we find it in the legal sense of ‘tenant-farmer’ as opposed to ‘owner,’
<i>dominus</i>. He refers in both groups of poems to the military colonists<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>
pensioned by Augustus with grants of land. In neither place is the
word <i>coloni</i> used; this is natural enough. We need only note the care
with which the court-poet refers to the matter. His master doubtless
had many an anxious hour over that settlement: the poet refers to
the granting of lands, and does not touch on the disturbance caused
thereby. Nor is Horace peculiar in this respect. The caution that
marks the utterances of all the Augustan writers is very apt to mislead
us when we try to form a notion of the actual situation. The general
truth seems to be that the beginning of the Empire was a time of unrest
tempered by exhaustion, and that things only calmed down gradually
as the sufferers of the elder generation died out. Wealth was now the
one aim of most ambitions, and the race to escape poverty was extreme.
The merchant<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> in Horace is a typical figure. For a while he may have
had enough of seafaring perils and turn with joy to the rural quiet of
his country town: but to vegetate on narrow means is more than he
can stand, and he is off to the seas again. He is contrasted with the
farmer content to till his ancestral fields, whom no prospect of gain
would tempt to face the dangers of the deep: and he is I believe a
much more average representative of the age than the acquiescent
farmer.</p>

<p>One passage in the works of Horace calls for special discussion by
itself, for the value of its evidence depends on the interpretation
accepted, and opinions have differed. In the fourteenth epistle of the
first book the poet expresses his preference for country life in the
form of an address to the steward of his Sabine estate, beginning with
these lines</p>

<p class="noindent">and the question at once arises, what sort of persons are meant by
these ‘five good fathers.’ In agreement with the excellent note of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
Wilkins I hold that they are free heads of households, and that they
are persons existing in the then present time, not imagined figures of
a former age. It seems also clear that they were living on the modest
estate (<i>agellus</i>) of Horace. If so, then they can hardly be other than
tenants of farms included therein. Therefore it has naturally been
inferred that the estate consisted of a <i>villa</i> with a home-farm managed
by a steward controlling the staff of eight slaves of whom we hear
elsewhere: and that the outlying portions were let to free farmers<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> on
terms of money rent or shares of produce. Horace would thus be the
landlord of five <i>coloni</i>, and his relations with them would normally be
kept up through the agency of the resident slave-steward of the home-farm.
All this agrees perfectly with other evidence as to the customary
arrangements followed on rural estates; and I accept it as a valuable
illustration of a system not new but tending to become more and
more prevalent as time went on. But it is well to note that the case
is one from a hill district, and that we must not from it draw any
inference as to how things were moving on the great lowland estates,
the chief latifundial farm-areas of Italy.</p>

<p>The <i>patres</i> referred to are virtually <i>patres familias</i><a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>, free responsible
persons, probably Roman citizens, but tenants, not landowning yeomen
of the ancient type. Whether their visits to Varia (Vicovaro) were to
bear their part in the local affairs of their market-town, or to buy and
sell, or for both purposes, is not quite clear; nor does it here concern
us. But we should much like to know whether these five farmers, or
some of them, employed<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> any slaves. I do not see how this curiosity
is to be gratified. Perhaps we may argue that their assumed liberty
to come and go points to the employment of some labour other than
their own: but would this labour be slave or free? If we assume (as I
think we fairly may) that the labour needed would be mainly regular
routine-work and not occasional help, this points rather to slave-labour.
Nor is there any general reason for distrusting that conclusion; only
it would probably mean slave-labour on a small scale. There is moreover
no reason to think that free wage-labourers for regular routine
work were plentiful in the Sabine hills. And these small farmers were
not likely to be creditors, served by debtors (<i>obaerati</i>) working off
arrears of debt, a class of labour which according to Varro seems to
have been no longer available in Italy. There I must leave this question,
for I can add no more.</p>

<p>It remains to ask whether the identification of <i>patres</i> with <i>patres
familias</i> exhausts the full meaning of the word. In the <i>Aeneid</i> (<span class="allsmcap">XII</span> 520)
a combatant slain is described as by craft a poor fisherman of Lerna,
no dependant of the wealthy, and then follow the words <i>conductaque pater
tellure serebat</i>. Now most commentators and translators seem determined
to find in this a reference to the man’s father, which is surely
flat and superfluous. The stress is not on <i>pater</i> but on <i>conducta</i>. Is not
<i>pater</i> an honourable quality-term, referring to the man<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> himself? He
would not be always fishing in the lake. He had a dwelling of some
sort, most probably a patch of land, to grow his vegetables. The point
is that even this was not his own, but hired from some landowner. I
would render ‘and the land where the honest man used to grow a crop
from seed was rented from another.’ That <i>pater</i> (Aeneas etc) is often
used as a complimentary prefix, is well known, and I think it delicately
expresses the poet’s kindly appreciation of the poor but honest and
independent rustic. In the passage of Horace I am inclined to detect
something of the same flavour. Some have supposed that the five
‘fathers’ were decurions of the local township of Varia, who went thither
to meetings of the local senate. I shrink from reading this into the
words of Horace, all the more as Nissen<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> has shewn good reason for
doubting whether Varia was anything more than a subordinate hamlet
(<i>vicus</i>) of Tibur.</p>

<p>The general effect of the words, taken in context with the rest of
the epistle, is this: the <i>vilicus</i>, once a common slave-labourer (<i>mediastinus</i>)
in Rome, hankers after town life, finding his rustic stewardship
dull on a small estate such as that of Horace. To Horace the place
is a charming retreat from the follies and worries of Rome. To him
the estate with its quiet homestead and the five tenants of the outlying
farms is an ideal property: he wants<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> a retreat, not urban excitements.
To the steward it seems that there is ‘nothing doing,’ while the
grandeur of a great estate is lacking. So the master is contented,
while the slave is discontented, with this five-farm property looked at
from their different points of view.</p>

<p>But the most serious problem that meets us in endeavouring to
appraise the evidence of the Augustan literature is connected with
the <i>Georgics</i> of Vergil. Passages from Horace will be helpful in this
inquiry, in the course of which the remarkable difference between these
two witnesses will appear. The stray references in other writers of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
period are for the most part not worth citing. <b>Tibullus</b> speaks of the
farmer<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> who has had his fill of steady ploughing, but this is in an ideal
picture of the origins of agriculture. His rural scenes are not of much
significance. In one place, speaking of hope<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> that sustains a man in
uncertainties, for instance a farmer, he adds ‘Hope it is too that comforts
one bound with a strong chain: the iron clanks on his legs, yet
he sings as he works.’ A rustic slave, no doubt. But that his hope is
hope of manumission is by no means clear: it may be hope of escape,
and the words are indefinite, perhaps left so purposely. That <b>Ovid</b><a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>
refers to the farmer statesmen and heroes of yore, who put their hands
to the plough, is merely an illustration of the retrospective idealism of
the Augustan age. Like Livy and the rest, he was conscious of the
decay of Roman vitality, and amid the glories and dissipations of
Rome recognized the vigour and simplicity of good old times. For
him, and for <b>Manilius</b>, speculation<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> as to the origins of civilization,
imaginings of a primitive communism, had attraction, as it had for
Lucretius and Vergil. It was part of the common stock: and in connexion
with the development of building it forms a topic of some
interest<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> in the <i>architectura</i> of <b>Vitruvius</b>.</p>

<p><b>Vergil.</b> All readers of Vergil’s <i>Georgics</i> are struck by the poet’s
persistent glorification of labour and his insistence on the necessity and
profit of personal action on the farmer’s part. Yet on one very important
point there is singular obscurity. Is slave-labour meant to be a part of
his <i>res rustica</i>, or not? When he bids the farmer do this or that, is he
bidding him to do it with his own hands, or merely to see to the doing of
it, or sometimes the one and sometimes the other? So far as I know,
no sufficient attention<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> has been given to the curious, and surely deliberate,
avoidance of direct reference to slavery in this poem. To this
subject I propose to return after considering the references in his
pastoral and epic poetry. For in the artificial world of piping shepherds
and in the surroundings of heroic legend the mention of slaves and
slavery is under no restraint. This I hope to make clear; and, in
relation to the contrast presented by the <i>Georgics</i>, to emphasize, if not
satisfactorily to explain, one of the subtle reticencies of Vergil.</p>

<p>The <i>Bucolics</i> place us in an unreal atmosphere. The scenic setting
is a blend of Theocritean Sicily and the poet’s own lowlands of the
Cisalpine. The characters and status of the rustics are confused in a
remarkable degree. Thus in the first eclogue Tityrus appears as a slave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
who has bought his freedom late in life (lines 27-9), having neglected
to amass a <i>peculium</i> in earlier years (31-2). It was only by a visit
to Rome, and the favour of Octavian, that he gained relief. But this
relief appears, not as manumission, but as the restoration of a landowner
dispossessed by a military colonist. The inconsistency cannot
be removed by treating the first version as symbolic or allegorical. It
is there, and the poet seems to have felt no sufficient inducement to
remove it. Corydon in the second eclogue has a <i>dominus</i>, and is therefore
<i>servus</i> (2). Yet he boasts of his large property in flocks, which are
presumably his <i>peculium</i> (19-22). His dwelling is a lowly cot in the rough
grubby surroundings of the countryside (28-9). He is <i>pastor</i> (1), but
there are evidently <i>aratores</i> on the estate (66). He is warned that, if
it comes to buying favours with gifts, he cannot compete with his
master Iollas (57). Had he not better do some basket-work and forget
his passion (71-3)?</p>

<p>In the third eclogue the status of Damoetas is far from clear. He
appears as <i>alienus custos</i> of a flock, the love-rival of the owner (<i>ipse</i>),
whom he is robbing, profiting by the latter’s preoccupation with his
amour (1-6). He is in short head-shepherd (101 <i>pecoris magistro</i>), and
Tityrus (96) seems to be his underling. Menalcas in staking the cups
explains that he dare not risk any of the flock under his charge, which
belongs to his father and is jealously counted (32-43). He is owner’s
son, with no opportunities of fraud; probably free, for we can hardly
assume that the flock is a slave’s <i>peculium</i>. But whether Damoetas is
(<i>a</i>) a free hireling or (<i>b</i>) a slave hired from another owner or (<i>c</i>) a slave
of the flock-owner, is not to be inferred with confidence from so indistinct
a picture. In the ninth eclogue we are again<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> brought across the
rude military colonist (4) of the first eclogue. Moeris, who seems to be
the steward of Menalcas, speaks of <i>nostri</i> (<i>agelli</i>, 2) and <i>nostra</i> (<i>carmina</i>,
12). Menalcas is <i>ipse</i> (16), and supposed to represent Vergil. I incline
to believe that Moeris is a slave <i>vilicus</i>, but cannot feel sure. So also
in the tenth, we hear of <i>opilio</i> and <i>subulci</i> (19), of <i>custos gregis</i> and
<i>vinitor</i> (36). These would in the Italy of Vergil’s time be normally
slaves. But it is not the question of their status that is uppermost in
the poet’s mind. They appear in the picture merely as figures suggesting
the rustic environment on which he loves to dwell. As for the fourth
eclogue, it is only necessary to remark that, however interpreted, it
points to the return (6) of a blissful age, and accordingly assumes the
former existence of good old times.</p>

<p>It has been justly noted that the merry singing and easy life of the
swains in the <i>Bucolics</i> are incongruous with the notorious condition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
the rustic slaves of Italy. No doubt the contrast is painful. But we
must not presume to impute to the great and generous poet a light-headed
and callous indifference to the miseries daily inflicted by
capitalist exploiters of labour on their human chattels. We must not
forget that in hill districts, where large-scale farming did not pay, rural
life was still going on in old-fashioned grooves. Nor must we forget
that in his native Cisalpine slavery was probably of a mild character.
Some hundred years later we hear<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> that chained gangs of slave-labourers
were not employed there: and the great armies recruited there in Caesar’s
time do not suggest that the free population had dwindled there as in
Etruria or Lucania. The song-loving shepherds are an importation from
the Sicily of Theocritus, an extinct past, an artificial world kept alive
in literature by the genius of its singer. In the hands of his great
imitator the rustic figures become even more unreal. Hence the extreme
difficulty of extracting any sure evidence on the status of these characters,
or signs of the poet’s own sentiments, from the language of the
<i>Bucolics</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Aeneid</i> we have the legends of ancient Italy and the origin
of Rome subjected to epic treatment. The drift of the poem is conditioned
by modern influence, the desire of Augustus to gain support for
the new Empire by fostering every germ of a national sentiment. The
tale of Troy has to be exploited for the purpose, and with the tale of
Troy comes the necessity of reproducing so far as possible the atmosphere
of the ‘heroic’ age. There is therefore hardly any reference to
the matters with which I am now concerned. When the poet speaks<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
of the peoples of ancient Italy it is in terms of general praise. Their
warlike vigour and hardihood, the active life of hunters and farmers,
can be admired without informing the reader whether they employed
slave-labour or not. And in the rare references<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> to slavery in his own
day Vergil has in mind the relation of master and slave simply, without
any regard to agriculture. But in depicting the society of the ‘heroic’
times, in which the adventures of Aeneas are laid, a substratum of
slavery was indispensable. It was therefore drawn from the Greek epic,
where it lay ready to hand. Yet the references to slaves are less
numerous than we might have expected. We find them employed in
table-service (<span class="allsmcap">I</span> 701-6), or as personal attendants (<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 580, 712, <span class="allsmcap">IV</span> 391,
<span class="allsmcap">V</span> 263, <span class="allsmcap">IX</span> 329, <span class="allsmcap">XI</span> 34). We hear of a woman skilled in handicrafts
(<span class="allsmcap">V</span> 284) given as a prize, and Camilla is dedicated as a <i>famula</i> of Diana
(<span class="allsmcap">XI</span> 558). These are not very significant references. But that slavery
is assumed as an important element in the social scheme may be inferred
from the references to captives in war (<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 786, <span class="allsmcap">III</span> 323, <span class="allsmcap">IX</span> 272-3).
They are liable to be offered up as <i>inferiae</i> to the dead (<span class="allsmcap">XI</span> 81-2),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
and the victor takes the females as concubines at will (<span class="allsmcap">III</span> 323-9, <span class="allsmcap">IX</span>
546). A discarded concubine is handed over to a slave-consort (<span class="allsmcap">III</span> 329),
and the infant children of a <i>serva</i> form part of a common unit with
their dam (<span class="allsmcap">V</span> 285).</p>

<p>Two passages are worth notice from an economic point of view.
In <span class="allsmcap">VIII</span> 408-12, in a simile, we have the picture of a poor hard-working
housewife who rises very early to set her <i>famulae</i> to work on their
allotted tasks of wool, to ‘keep the little home together.’ One can hardly
say that no such scene was possible in real life under the conditions
of Vergil’s time, though we may fairly doubt the reality of a picture in
which grim poverty and the desire to bring up a family of young
children are combined with the ownership and employment of a staff
of domestic slaves. For we find the not owning a single slave<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> used as
the most characteristic sign of poverty. And I shrink from describing
the situation industrially as the sweating of slave-labour to maintain
respectability. I do not think any such notion was in the poet’s mind.
That the simile is suggested by Greek models is pointed out by
Conington, and to regard it as a borrowed ornament is probably the
safest conclusion in general. It is however to be noted that the <i>famulae</i>
are not borrowed, but an addition of Vergil’s own. The other passage,
<span class="allsmcap">XII</span> 517-20, relates the death in battle of an Arcadian, who in his
home was a fisherman, of humble station. The last point is brought
out in the words<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> <i>conductaque pater tellure serebat</i>. This seems to mean
that he was a small tenant farmer, a <i>colonus</i> of the non-owning class.
Such a man might or might not have a slave or two. But, even were
there any indication (which there is not) to favour either alternative,
the man’s home is in Arcadia, though the picture may be coloured by
the poet’s familiarity with Italian details. Take it all in all, we are
perhaps justified in saying that in the <i>Aeneid</i> the realities of slavery
and of humble labour generally are very lightly touched. Is this wholly
due to the assumed proprieties of the heroic epic, dealing with characters
above the ordinary freeman in station or natural qualities? Or may we
surmise that to Vergil, with his intense human sympathies, the topic
was in itself also distasteful, only to be referred to when it was hardly
possible to avoid it?</p>

<p>If little, in fact almost nothing, can be gleaned bearing on the subject
of labour from the <i>Bucolics</i> and <i>Aeneid</i>, we might hope to find
plenty of information in the didactic poem specially addressed to farmers.
In the opening of the <i>Georgics</i> (<span class="allsmcap">I</span> 41) Vergil plainly says that he feels
sorry for the rustic folk, who know not the path to success in their
vocation: he appeals to the gods interested in agriculture, and above
all to Augustus, to look kindly on his bold endeavour to set farmers in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
the right way. When he comes to speak of the peace and plenty, the
security and joys, of country life, he grows enthusiastic (<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 458-74).
But among the advantages he does not omit to reckon the freedom
from the extravagance and garish display of city life, the freedom to
drowse under trees, the enjoyment of rural sights and sounds, in short
the freedom to take your ease with no lack of elbow-room (<i>latis otia
fundis</i>). This hardly portrays the life of the working farmer, to whom
throughout the poem he is ever preaching the gospel of toil and watchfulness.
True, he adds ‘there you find forest-lands (<i>saltus</i>) with coverts
for wild beasts, and a population inured to toil and used to scanty
diet,’ among whom yet linger survivals of the piety and righteousness
of old. It is fair to ask, who are these and what place do they fill in
the poet’s picture? Surely they are not the men who have fled from
the vain follies of the city: for they are genuine rustics. Surely not
gang-slaves, driven out to labour in the fields and back again to be fed
and locked up, like oxen or asses. To the urban slave transference to
such a life was a dreaded punishment. Are they free small-scale farmers?
No doubt there were still many of that class remaining in the upland
parts of Italy. But were they men of leisure, able to take their ease at
will on broad estates? I cannot think of them in such a character,
unless I assume them to own farms of comfortable size (of course not
<i>latifundia</i>) and to employ some labour of slaves or hirelings. And there
is nothing in the context to justify such an assumption. Lastly, are
they poor peasants, holding small plots of land and eking out a meagre
subsistence by occasional wage-earning labour? Such persons seem to
have existed, at least in certain parts of the country: but we know that
some at least of this labour hired for the job was performed<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> by bands
of non-resident labourers roaming in search of such employment. No,
peasants of the ‘crofter’ type do not fit in with this picture of a rural
life passed in plenty and peaceful ease. I am therefore driven to conclude
that the poet was merely idealizing country life in general terms
without troubling himself to exercise a rigid consistency in the combination
of details. He has had many followers among poets and
painters, naturally: but the claim of the <i>Georgics</i> to rank as a didactic
treatise is exceptionally strong, owing to the citations of Columella
and Pliny. If then the poem seems in any respect to pass lightly over
questions of importance in the consideration of farming conditions, we
are tempted rather to seek for a motive than to impute neglect.</p>

<p>But before proceeding further it is well to inquire in what sense
the <i>Georgics</i> can be called didactic. What is the essential teaching of
the poem, and to whom is that teaching addressed? In outward form
it professes to instruct the bewildered farmers, suffering at the time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
from effects of the recent civil wars as well as from economic difficulties
of old standing; and to convey sound precepts for the conduct of
agriculture in its various branches. But there is little doubt that the
precepts are all or most of them taken directly from earlier<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> writers,
Roman or Greek; and we may reasonably suppose that most of them
(and those the most practical ones) were well known to the very classes
most concerned in their application. It is absurd to suppose that
agricultural tradition had utterly died out. The real difficulty was to
put it in practice. Now, what class of farmers were to be benefited by
the new poem? Was the peasant of the uplands, soaked in hereditary
experience, to learn his business over again with the help of the poet-laureate’s
fascinating verse? Surely he spoke a rustic<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> Latin, and
sometimes hardly that. Was it likely that he would gradually absorb
the doctrines of the Vergilian compendium, offered in the most refined
language and metre of literary Rome? It is surely inconceivable. Nor
can we assume that any remaining intensive farmers of the Campanian
plain were in much need of practical instruction: what was needed
there was a respite from the unsettling disturbances of the revolutionary
period. To suggest that a part of the poet’s design was to supply
much-needed teaching to the new <i>coloni</i> from the disbanded armies,
would be grotesque in any case, and above all in that of Vergil. If
we are to find a class of men to whom the finished literary art of the
<i>Georgics</i> would appeal, and who might profit by the doctrines so
attractively conveyed, we must seek them in social strata<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> possessed
of education enough to appreciate the poem and sympathize with its
general tone. Now all or most of such persons would be well-to-do
people, owners of property, often of landed property: people of more
or less leisure: in short, the cultured class, whose centre was Rome.
These people would view with favour any proposal for the benefit of
Italian agriculture. Many landowners at the time had got large estates
cheaply in the time of troubles, and to them anything likely to improve
the value of their lands, and to draw a curtain of returning prosperity
over a questionable past, would doubtless be welcome. They would
applaud the subtle grace with which the poet glorified the duty and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
profit of personal labour. But that they meant to work with their own
hands I cannot believe. In the true spirit of their age, they would as
a matter of course take the profit, and delegate the duty to others.</p>

<p>Two alternatives<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> presented themselves to a landowner. He might
let his estate whole or in parcels to a tenant or tenants. Or he might
work it for his own account, either under his own resident direction,
or through the agency of a steward. All the evidence bearing on the
revolutionary period tends to shew that the resident landlord of a
considerable estate, farming his own land, was a very rare type indeed.
It was found most convenient as a general rule to let an out-of-the-way
farm to a cultivating tenant at a money rent or on a sharing system.
A more accessible one was generally put under a steward and so kept
in hand by the owner. The dwelling-house was in such cases improved
so as to be a fit residence for the proprietor on his occasional visits.
Growing luxury often carried this change to an extreme, and made
the <i>villa</i> a ‘place in the country,’ a scene of intermittent extravagance,
not of steady income-producing thrift. True, it seems that the crude
and wasteful system of the earlier <i>latifundia</i> had been a good deal
modified by the end of the Republic. A wealthy man preferred to
own several estates of moderate size situated near main routes of
traffic. But this plan required more stewards. And the steward (<i>vilicus</i>),
himself a slave, was the head of a slave-staff proportioned to the size
of the farm. Now the public effectually reached by the <i>Georgics</i> may
be supposed to have included the landowners of education and leisure,
whether they let their land to tenants or kept it in hand. I cannot
believe that the <i>coloni</i> farming hired land<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> came under the poet’s influence.
In other words, the <i>Georgics</i>, in so far as the poem made its
way beyond purely literary circles, appealed chiefly if not wholly to a
class dependent on slave-labour in every department of their lives.</p>

<p>Maecenas, to whom the poem is in form addressed, had put pressure
on Vergil to write it. At the back of Maecenas was the new Emperor,
anxious to enlist all the talents in the service of the new dispensation.
The revival of rural Italy was one of the praiseworthy projects of
the Emperor and his confidential minister. It was indeed on every
ground manifestly desirable. But was it possible now to turn Romans
of property into working farmers? Would the man-about-Rome
leave urban pleasures for the plough-tail? Not he! Nor are we to
assume that Augustus was fool enough to expect it. Then what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
about Maecenas? His enjoyment of luxurious ease<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> was a byword:
that he retained his native commonsense under such conditions is
one of his chief titles to fame. No one can have expected him to
wield the spade and mattock or spread manure. The poet writing
with such a man for patron and prompter was not likely to find his
precepts enjoining personal labour taken too seriously. His readers
were living in a social and moral atmosphere in which to do anything
involving labour meant ordering a slave to do it. That the
Emperor wished to see more people interested in the revival of Italian
agriculture was well understood. But this interest could be shown by
investing capital in Italian land; and this is what many undoubtedly
did. Recent proscriptions and confiscations had thrown numbers of
estates on the market. It was possible to get a good bargain and at
the same time win the favour of the new ruler by a well-timed proof
of confidence in the stability of the new government. Now it is to say
the least remarkable that Dion Cassius, doubtless following earlier
authorities, puts into the mouth of Maecenas some suggestions<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> on
this very subject. After advising the Emperor to raise a standing
army by enlisting the able-bodied unemployed men in Italy, and
pointing out that with the security thus gained, and the provision of
a harmless career for the sturdy wastrels who were at present a cause
of disorders, agriculture and commerce would revive, he proceeds as
follows. For these measures money will be needed, as it would under
any government: therefore the necessity of some exactions must be
faced. ‘The very first thing<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> then for you to do is to have a sale of
the confiscated properties, of which there are many owing to the wars,
reserving only a few that are specially useful or indispensable for your
purposes: and then to employ all the money so raised by lending it
out at moderate interest. If you do this, the land will be under cultivation
(ἐνεργός), being placed in the hands of owners who themselves
work (δεσπόταις αὐτουργοῖς δοθεῖσα): they will become more prosperous,
having the disposal of capital: and the treasury will have a sufficient
and perpetual income.’ He then urges the necessity of preparing a
complete budget estimate of regular receipts from the above and other
sources, and of the prospective regular charges both military and civil,
with allowance for unforeseen contingencies. ‘And your next step
should be to provide for any deficit by imposing a tax on all properties
whatsoever that bring a profit (ἐπικαρπίαν τινὰ) to the owner, and
by a system of tributary dues in all our subject provinces.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>That this long oration attributed by Dion to Maecenas is in great
part made up from details of the policy actually followed by the
Emperor, is I believe generally admitted. But I am not aware that
the universal income-tax suggested was imposed. The policy of encouraging
agriculture certainly formed part of the imperial scheme,
and the function of the <i>Georgics</i> was to bring the power of literature
to bear in support of the movement. The poet could hardly help referring
in some way to the crying need of a great agricultural revival.
He did it with consummate skill. He did not begin by enlarging on the
calamities of the recent past, and then proceed to offer his remedies. Such
a method would at once have aroused suspicion and ill-feeling. No, he
waited till he was able to glide easily into a noble passage in which he
speaks of the civil wars as a sort of doom sanctioned by the heavenly
powers. No party could take offence at this way of putting it. Then he
cries aloud to the Roman gods, not to prevent the man of the hour (<i>hunc
iuvenem</i>) from coming to the relief of a ruined generation. The needs
of the moment are such that we cannot do without him. The world is
full of wickedness and wars: ‘the plough is not respected as it should
be; the tillers of the soil have been drafted away, and the land is
gone to weeds; the crooked sickles are being forged into straight
swords.’ The passage comes at the end of the first book, following a
series of precepts delivered coolly and calmly as though in a social
atmosphere of perfect peace. The tone in which the words recall the
reader to present realities, and subtly hint at the obvious duty of
supporting the one possible restorer of Roman greatness, is an unsurpassed
feat of literary art. It is followed up at the end of the second
book in another famous passage, in which he preaches with equal
delicacy the doctrine that agricultural revival is the one sure road not
only to personal happiness but to the true greatness of the Roman
people.</p>

<p>That this revival was bound up with the return to a system of
farming on a smaller scale, implying more direct personal attention
on the landlord’s part, is obvious. But the poet goes further. His
model farmer is to be convinced of the necessity and benefit of personal
labour, and so to put his own hand to the plough. The glorification
of unyielding toil<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> as the true secret of success was (and is) a congenial
topic to preachers of the gospel of ‘back to the land.’ It may well be
that the thoughtful Vergil had misgivings as to the fruitfulness of his
doctrine. A cynical critic might hint that it was easy enough for one
man to urge others to work. But a man like Maecenas would smile
at such remarks. To set other people to do what he would never
dream of doing himself was to him the most natural thing in the world.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
So the pressure of the patron on the poet continued, and the <i>Georgics</i>
were born.</p>

<p>Let me now turn to certain passages of the poem in which farm-labour
is directly referred to, and see how far the status of the labourers
can be judged from the expressions used and the context. And first
of <i>aratores</i>. In <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 494 and <span class="allsmcap">II</span> 513 the <i>agricola</i> is a plowman; free, for
all that appears to the contrary. In <span class="allsmcap">II</span> 207, where he appears as clearing
off wood<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> and ploughing up the land, the <i>arator</i> is called <i>iratus</i>: this
can hardly apply to an indifferent slave. The <i>arator</i> of <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 261, represented
as turning the leisure enforced by bad weather to useful indoor
work, odd jobs in iron and wood work etc, may be one of a slave-staff
whom his master will not have idle. Or he may be the farmer himself.
The scene implies the presence of a staff of some kind, driven indoors
by the rain. And that the poet is not thinking of a solitary peasant is
further indicated by mention of sheep-washing, certainly not a ‘one-man-job,’
in line 272. Why Conington (after Heyne) takes <i>agitator
aselli</i> in 273 to be ‘the peasant who happens to drive the ass to market,’
and not an <i>asinarius</i> doing his regular duty, I cannot say. On <span class="allsmcap">III</span> 402,
a very similar passage, he takes the <i>pastor</i> to be probably the farm-slave,
not the owner, adding ‘though it is not always easy to see for
what class of men Virgil is writing.’ A remark which shews that my
present inquiry is not uncalled for. To return, there is nothing to
shew whether the ass-driver is a freeman or a slave. Nor is the status
of <i>messores</i><a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> clear. In <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 316-7 the farmer brings the mower on to the
yellow fields; that is, he orders his hands to put in the sickle. What
is their relation to him we do not hear. So too in <span class="allsmcap">II</span> 410 <i>postremus
metito</i> is a precept addressed to the farmer as farmer, not as potential
labourer. On the other hand the <i>messores</i> in the second and third
eclogues seem to be slaves, for there is reference to <i>domini</i> in both
poems.</p>

<p>The <i>fossor</i> is in literature the personification of mere heavy manual
labour. In default of evidence to the contrary, we must suppose him
to be normally<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> a slave. Thus the <i>fossor</i> of Horace <i>odes</i> <span class="allsmcap">III</span> 18 is probably
one of the <i>famuli operum soluti</i> of the preceding ode. But the
brawny digger of <i>Georgics</i> <span class="allsmcap">II</span> 264, who aids nature’s work by stirring
and loosening the caked earth, is left on a neutral footing. Nothing is
said. The reader must judge whether this silence is the result of pure
inadvertency. That <i>pastores</i> very often means slave-herdsmen, is well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
known. But Vergil seems to attribute to them a more real and intelligent
interest in the welfare of their charge than it is reasonable to
expect from rustic slaves. The <i>pastores</i> of <span class="allsmcap">IV</span> 278, who gather the
medicinal herb used in the treatment of bees, may be slaves: if so, they
are not mere thoughtless animals. And the scene is in the Cisalpine,
where we have noted that slavery was probably of a mild type. In
<span class="allsmcap">III</span> 420 the <i>pastor</i> is called upon to protect his beasts from snakes. But
we know<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> that it was a part of slave-herdsmen’s duty to fight beasts of
prey, and that they were commonly armed for that purpose. In <span class="allsmcap">III</span>
455 we find him shrinking from a little act of veterinary surgery, which
the context suggests he ought to perform. But we know that the
<i>magister pecoris</i> on a farm was instructed<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> in simple veterinary practice,
and it is hardly likely that other slaves, specially put in charge of
beasts, had no instructions. The <i>pastores</i> (if more than one, the chief,)
appear as <i>pecorum magistri</i> (<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 529, <span class="allsmcap">III</span> 445, cf <i>Buc</i> <span class="allsmcap">III</span> 101), a regular
name for shepherds: they are not the same as the <i>magistri</i> of <span class="allsmcap">III</span> 549,
who are veterinary specialists disguised under mythical names. In
<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 529-31 we have a holiday scene, in which the farmer (<i>ipse</i>) treats
the <i>pecoris magistri</i> to a match of wrestling and throwing the javelin.
If slaves are meant, then Vergil is surely carrying back rustic slavery
to early days as part and parcel of the ‘good old times’ to which he
points in the following lines <i>hanc olim veteres vitam coluere Sabini</i> etc.
The <i>ipse</i> will then be a genial farmer of the old school, whose slaves
are very different from the degraded and sullen chattels of more recent
years. But in this as in other cases the poet gives us no clear sign.</p>

<p>A passage<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> in which the reticence of which I am speaking has a
peculiar effect occurs in the description of the grievous murrain that
visited northern Italy some time before. One of a pair of oxen falls
dead while drawing the plough. The <i>tristis arator</i><a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> unyokes the other,
sorrow-stricken at the death of its fellow; he leaves the plough where
it stopped, and goes his way. Then follows a piece of highly-wrought
pathos<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> describing the dejection and collapse of the surviving ox.
‘What now avail him his toil or his services, his past work in turning
up the heavy land with the ploughshare?’ And the hardness of the
poor beast’s lot is emphasized by the reflexion that disease in cattle
is not induced by gluttony and wine-bibbing, as it often is in the
case of mankind, nor by the worries (<i>cura</i>) that rob men of refreshing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
sleep. This much-admired passage may remind us of the high value
set upon the ox in ancient Italy, traditionally amounting to a kind of
sanctity; for it is said<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> that to kill an ox was as great a crime as to
kill a man. We may wonder too what the luxurious but responsible
Maecenas thought of the lines contrasting the simple diet and untroubled
life of the ox with the excesses and anxieties of man. But, if
civilization owed much to the labours of the ox, and if gratitude was
due to man’s patient helper, what about the human slave? Is it not a
remarkable thing that the <i>Georgics</i> contain not a word of appreciative
reference to the myriads of toiling bondsmen whose sweat and sufferings
had been exploited by Roman landlords for at least 150 years? Can
this silence on the part of a poet who credits an ox with human affection
be regarded as a merely accidental omission?</p>

<p>Of poets in general it may I think be truly said that the relation
between the singer and his vocabulary varies greatly in various cases.
Personal judgments are very fallible: but to me, the more I read Vergil,
the more I see in him an extreme case of the poet ever nervously on
his guard<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> against expressing or suggesting any meaning or shade of
meaning beyond that which at a given moment he wishes to convey.
This is no original discovery. But in reaching it independently I have
become further convinced that the limitations of his vocabulary are
evidence of nice and deliberate selection. The number of well-established
Latin words, adaptable to verse and to the expression of
ideas certain to occur, that are used by other poets of note but not by
him, is considerable. I have a long list: here I will mention only one,
the adjective <i>vagus</i>. The word may have carried to him associations
below the pure dignity of his finished style. Yet Horace used it freely
in the <i>Odes</i>, and Horace was surely no hasty hack careless of propriety,
and no mean judge of what was proper. Now, when I turn to the
<i>Georgics</i>, Vergil’s most finished work, I am struck by the absence of
certain words the presence of which would seem natural, or even to be
expected, in any work professedly treating of agriculture in Roman
Italy. Thus <i>servus</i> does not occur at all, <i>serva</i> in the <i>Aeneid</i> only, and
<i>servitium</i> in the strict sense only <i>Buc</i> <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 40 and <i>Aen</i> <span class="allsmcap">III</span> 327. In <i>Georg</i>
<span class="allsmcap">III</span> 167-8 <i>ubi libera colla servitio adsuerint</i> he is speaking of the
breaking-in of young oxen<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> in figurative language. So too <i>dominus</i>
and <i>domina</i> occur in the <i>Bucolics</i> and <i>Aeneid</i> but not in the <i>Georgics</i>.
The case of <i>opera</i> and the plural <i>operae</i> may seem to be on a somewhat
different footing in so far as the special sense of <i>opera</i> = ‘the average<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
day’s work<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> of a labourer’ would perhaps have too technical and prosaic
a flavour. In the single instance (<i>Aen</i> <span class="allsmcap">VII</span> 331-2), where it occurs in
the familiar phrase <i>da operam</i>, it is coupled with <i>laborem</i>, which rather
suggests a certain timidity in the use of a colloquial expression. The
plural, frequent in the writers on agriculture, he does not use at all,
whether because he avoids the statistical estimates in which it most
naturally comes, or from sheer fastidiousness due to the disreputable
associations of <i>operae</i> in political slang. Perhaps neither of these reasons
is quite enough to account for the absence of the word from the <i>Georgics</i>.
That <i>famulus</i> and <i>famula</i> occur in the <i>Aeneid</i> only is not surprising,
for they represent the δμῶες and δμωαὶ of Greek heroic poetry. But
<i>famula</i> appears in the <i>Moretum</i>, of which I will speak below.</p>

<p>That Vergil is all the while pointing the way to a system of small
farms and working farmers, though some topics (for instance stock-keeping)
seem to touch on a larger scale of business, may be gathered
from his references to <i>coloni</i>. The word is in general used merely as
the substantive corresponding to <i>colere</i>, and its place is often taken
by <i>agricola</i> (<span class="allsmcap">I</span> 300, <span class="allsmcap">II</span> 459) or <i>rusticus</i> (<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 406) or other substitutes. In
<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 433 <i>homines</i> means much the same as the <i>agrestis</i> of <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 41, only that
the former need stimulus and the latter guidance. The typical picture
of the <i>colonus</i> comes in <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 291-302, where the small farmer and his
industrious wife are seen taking some relaxation in the winter season,
but never idle. It is surely a somewhat idealized picture. The parallel
in Horace (<i>epode</i> <span class="allsmcap">II</span>) is more matter-of-fact, and clearly includes slaves,
an element ignored by Vergil. The <i>colonus</i> is not a mere tenant farmer,
but a yeoman tilling his own land, like the <i>veteres coloni</i> of the ninth
eclogue, a freeman, and we may add liable to military service, like those
in <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 507 whose conscription left the farms derelict. A curious and
evidently exceptional case is that of the <i>Corycius senex</i> (<span class="allsmcap">IV</span> 125-46),
said to be one of Pompey’s pirate colonists. The man is a squatter on
a patch of unoccupied land, which he has cultivated as a garden, raising
by unwearied industry quite wonderful crops of vegetables fruit and
flowers, and remarkably successful<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> as a bee-keeper. Perhaps this transplanted
Oriental had no slave, at least when he started gardening. But
I note that his croft was more than a <i>iugerum</i> (<i>pauca relicti iugera
ruris</i>) at the time when Vergil saw it, and I imagine the process of
reclaiming the waste to have been gradual. When this small holding
was complete and in full bearing, would the work of one elderly man
suffice to carry it on? I wonder. But we get no hint of a slave or a
hireling, or even of a wife. All I can venture to say is that this story
is meant to be significant of the moral and material wellbeing of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
small cultivator. It is curious that just above (118, cf 147-8) the poet
is at pains to excuse his omission to discuss in detail the proper
management of <i>horti</i>, on the pretext of want of space. For he was no
mean antiquary, and Pliny tells<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> us that in the Twelve Tables <i>hortus</i>
was used of what was afterwards called <i>villa</i>, a country farm, while
<i>heredium</i> stood for a garden; and adds that in old time <i>per se hortus
ager pauperis erat</i>. But <i>hortus</i> is to Vergil strictly a garden, and the
old Corycian is cited expressly as a gardener: his land, we are told,
was not suited for growing corn or vines.</p>

<p>The mention of gardening invites me to say a few words on the
short descriptive idyll <i>Moretum</i> which has been regarded as a youthful
composition of Vergil (perhaps from a Greek original) with more justice
than some other pieces attributed to him. I see no strong objection to
admitting it as Vergilian, but it is of course crude and far removed
from the manner and finish of the mature <i>Georgics</i>. The peasant
Simylus, <i>exigui cultor rusticus agri</i>, is a poor small farmer whose thrift
and industry enable him to make a living ‘in a humble and pottering
way,’ as Gilbert puts it. His holding is partly ordinary arable land,
but includes a <i>hortus</i> as well. In the latter he skilfully grows a variety
of vegetables, for which he finds a regular market in the city. Poor
though he is, and accustomed to wait on himself, apparently unmarried,
he yet owns a slave (<i>famulam</i>, 93) and she is a negro, fully described
(31-5), woolly hair, thick lips, dark skin, spindle shanks, paddle feet,
etc. She probably would do the house-work, but the preparation of
food is a duty in which her master also bears a part. We hear of no
male slave, and the ploughing of fields and digging the garden are
apparently done by himself singlehanded. The yoke of oxen are mentioned
in the last lines. The picture is such as may have been true of
some humble homesteads in Italy, but the tradition of a Greek original,
and the names Simylus and Scybale, must leave us in some doubt as
to whether the scene be really Italian. The position is in fact much
the same as it is in regard to the <i>Bucolics</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the correct view as to the authorship and bearing
of the <i>Moretum</i>, there are I think certain conclusions to be drawn from
an examination of the <i>Georgics</i>, which it is time to summarize. First,
the tendency of the poem is to advocate a system of smaller holdings
and more intensive cultivation than had for a long period been customary
in a large part of Italy. This reform is rather suggested by implication
than directly urged, though one precept, said to be borrowed<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> from old
Cato, recommends it in plain words. For the glorification of labour in
general is all the while pointing in this direction. Secondly, the policy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
of the new Emperor, who posed as Restorer and Preserver rather than
Reformer, finds a sympathetic or obedient expression in this tendency.
For it is delicately conveyed that the reform of an evil agricultural
present virtually consists in the return to the ways of a better past.
And the poet, acting as poet simply, throws on this better past the
halo of a golden age still more remote. The virtues of the Sabines of
old<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> are an example of the happiness and honour attainable by a rustic
folk. But to Vergil, steeped in ancient legend, the historic worthies
of a former age are not the beginning of things. They come ‘trailing
clouds of glory’ from the mythical origin<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> of mankind, from a world
of primeval abundance and brotherly communism, a world which he
like Lucretius pauses to portray. Thirdly, the reaction of Augustus
against the bold cosmopolitanism of Julius Caesar has I think left a
mark on the <i>Georgics</i> in the fact that the poem is, as Sellar says, so
thoroughly representative of Italy. Roman Italy was not yet ready
to become merely a part of an imperial estate. If people were to
acquiesce in a monarchy, it had to be disguised, and one important
disguise was the make-believe that the Roman people were lords of
the world. A very harmless method of ministering to Roman self-complacency
was excessive praise of Italy, its soil, its climate, its
natural features, its various products, its races of men and their works,
and all the historic associations of the victorious past. It is a notable
fact that this panegyric<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> breaks out in the utterances of four very dissimilar
works that still survive: for beside the <i>Georgics</i> I must place<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
the so-called <i>Roman Antiquities</i> of Dionysius, the <i>Geography</i> of Strabo,
and the <i>de re rustica</i> of Varro. These four are practically contemporaries.
It seems to me hardly credible that there was not some common
influence operative at the time and encouraging utterances of this tone.</p>

<p>The actual success or failure of the attempt to revive Roman
agriculture on a better footing is not only a question of fact in itself
historically important: its determination will throw light on the circumstances
in which Vergil wrote, and perhaps help somewhat in
suggesting reasons for his avoidance of certain topics. If we are to
believe Horace<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>, the agricultural policy of Augustus was a grand success:
security, prosperity, virtue, good order, had become normal:
fertility had returned to the countryside. I had better say at once
that I put little faith in these utterances of a court poet. Far more
significant is the statement, preserved by Suetonius<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>, of the evils dealt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
with by Augustus in country districts. Parties of armed bandits infested
the country. Travellers, slaves and freemen alike, were kidnapped
and <i>ergastulis possessorum supprimebantur</i>. He checked the
brigandage by armed police posted at suitable spots, and <i>ergastula
recognovit</i>. But it is not said that he did away with them: he cleared
out of them the persons illegally held in bondage (<i>suppressi</i>). Not
only is rustic slavery in full swing in the treatise of Varro: some 80
years later the <i>ergastulum</i> is adopted as a matter of course by Columella,
and appears as a canker of agriculture in the complaints of
Pliny. The neglect of rustic industry is lamented by all three writers,
and to the testimony of such witnesses it is quite needless to add
quotations from writers of merely literary merit. There is no serious
doubt that the reconstruction of agriculture on the basis of small
farms tilled by working farmers was at best successful in a very
moderate degree; and this for many a long year. Organized slave-labour
remained the staple appliance of tillage until the growing
scarcity of slaves and the financial policy of the later Empire brought
about the momentous change by which the free farmer gradually became
the predial serf.</p>

<p>Another point to be noted in the <i>Georgics</i> is the absence of any
reference to <i>coloni</i> as tenants under a landlord. Yet we know that this
relation existed in Cicero’s time, and tenant farmers appear in Varro<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
and Columella<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>. Vergil, but for a stray reference in the <i>Aeneid</i>, might
seem never to have heard of the existence of such people. It is easy
to say that the difference between an owner and a tenant is a difference
in law, and unsuited for discussion in a poem. But it also
involves economic problems. The landlord wants a good return on his
capital, the tenant wants to make a good living, and the conditions of
tenancy vary greatly in various cases. The younger Pliny<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> had to deal
with awkward questions between him and his tenants, and there is no
reason to suppose that his case was exceptional. Surely the subject
was one of immediate interest to an agricultural reformer, quite as
interesting as a number of the details set forth here and there in the
<i>Georgics</i>; that is, assuming that the author meant his farmer to be
economically prosperous as well as to set a good example. It may be
argued that the operations enjoined on the farmer would greatly improve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the farm and enhance the value of the land, and that no man
in his senses would do this unless the land were his own: there was
therefore no need to discuss tenancy, ownership being manifestly
implied. The argument is fair, so far as it goes. But it does not justify
complete silence on what was probably at the moment a question of
no small importance in the eyes of landowners.</p>

<p>Some passages of Horace may serve to shew that circumstances
might have justified or even invited some reference to this topic. In
the seventh <i>epistle</i> of the first book he tells the story of how Philippus
played a rather scurvy trick on a freedman in a small way of business
as an auctioneer. As a social superior, his patronage turned the poor
man’s head. Taking him for an outing to his own Sabine country
place, he infected him with desire of a rustic life. He amused himself
by persuading him to buy a small farm, offering him about £60 as a
gift and a loan of as much more. The conversion of a regular town-bred
man into a thoroughgoing farmer was of course a pitiful failure.
Devotion and industry availed him nothing. The losses and disappointments
incidental to farming were too much for him. He seems
to have had no slave: he probably had not sufficient capital. He
ended by piteously entreating his patron to put him back into his own
trade. The story is placed about two generations before Horace wrote.
But it would be pointless if it were out of date in its setting, which it
surely is not; it might have happened to a contemporary, nay to
Horace himself. It is addressed to his own patron Maecenas, the
generous donor of his own Sabine estate. Here we have a clear intimation
that to buy a little plot and try to get a living out of it by
your own labour was an enterprise in which success was no easy
matter. In the second <i>satire</i> of the second book we have the case of
Ofellus, one of the yeomen of the old school. He had been a working
farmer on his own land, but in the times of trouble his farm had been
confiscated and made over to a discharged soldier. But this veteran
wisely left him in occupation as cultivator on terms. Whether he
became a sort of farm-bailiff, working for the new owner’s account at
a fixed salary, or whether he became a tenant, farming on his own
account and paying a rent, has been doubted. I am strongly of the
second opinion. For it was certainly to the owner’s interest that the
land should be well-farmed, and that his own income (the endowment
of his later years) should be well-secured by giving the farmer every
motive for industry. These considerations do not suit well with the
former alternative, which also makes <i>colonus</i> hardly distinguishable
from <i>vilicus</i>. Again, the <i>colonus</i> is on the farm<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>
    <i>cum pecore et gnatis</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
The <i>pecus</i>, like the children, is surely the farmer’s own, and it is much
more likely that the live-stock should belong to a rent-paying tenant
than to a salaried bailiff. Moreover, there is no mention of slaves.
The man works the farm with the help of his family. Is it likely that
he would turn them into a household of serfs? Therefore I render line
115 <i>fortem mercede colonum</i> ‘a sturdy tenant-farmer sitting at a rent’;
that is, on a holding that as owner he formerly occupied rent-free. He
can make the farm pay even now: as for the mere fact of ground-landlordship,
that is an idle boast, and in any case limited by the span
of human life. I claim that these two passages are enough to prove
the point for which I am contending; namely, that questions of the
tenure under which agriculture could best be carried on were matters
of some interest and importance about the time when Vergil was
writing the <i>Georgics</i>.</p>

<p>But the help of Horace is by no means exhausted. He refers to a
story of a wage-earning labourer (<i>mercennarius</i>) who had the luck to
turn up a buried treasure, a find which enabled him to buy the very
farm on which he was employed, and work it as his own. There is no
point in this ‘yarn’ unless it was a well-known tale, part of the current
stock of the day. The famous <i>satire</i> in which it occurs (<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 6) seems to
be almost exactly contemporary with the appearance of the <i>Georgics</i>.
In it the restful charm of country life is heartily preferred to the
worries and boredom of Rome. His Sabine estate, with its garden, its
unfailing spring of water, and a strip of woodland, is of no great size,
but it is enough: he is no greedy land-grabber. When in Rome he
longs for it. There he can take his ease among spoilt young slaves,
born<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> on the place, keeping a sort of Liberty Hall for his friends. The
talk at table is not <i>de villis domibusve alienis</i> but of a more rational
and improving kind: envy of other men’s wealth is talked out with an
apposite fable. Here we have mention of wage-earning, land-purchase,
and slaves. And the poet’s estate is evidently in the first place a residence,
not a farm worked on strict economic lines. That the number of
slave hands (<i>operae</i>) employed there on the Home Farm<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> was eight, we
learn from another <i>satire</i> (<span class="allsmcap">II</span> 7 118). To the smart country seats, which
advertise the solid wealth of rich capitalists, he refers in express terms
in <i>epistles</i> <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 15 45-6, and by many less particular references. The
land-grabbers are often mentioned, and the forest-lands (<i>saltus</i>) used
for grazing, in which much money was invested by men ‘land-proud,’
as a sign of their importance. In short, the picture of rural Italy given
by Horace reveals to us a state of things wholly unfavourable to the
reception of the message of the <i>Georgics</i>. When he speaks of <i>pauper
ruris colonus</i> or of <i>inopes coloni</i> he is surely not betraying envy of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
toilers’ lot. Far from it. When enjoying a change in his country place,
he may occasionally divert himself with a short spell<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> of field-work, at
which his neighbours grin. On the other hand the spectacle of a disreputable
freedman, enriched by speculations in time of public calamity,
and enabled through ill-gotten wealth to become a great landlord, is
the cause of wrathful indignation (<i>epode</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>). And these and other
candid utterances come from one whose father was a freedman in a
country town, farming in quite a small way, to whose care and self-denial
the son owed the education that equipped him for rising in the
world. Horace indeed is one of the best of witnesses on these points.</p>

<p>There are points on which Vergil and Horace are agreed, though
generally with a certain difference of attitude. Thus, both prefer the
country to the town, but Horace frankly because he enjoys it and likes
a rest: he does not idealize country life as such, still less agricultural
labour. Both disapprove <i>latifundia</i>, but Horace on simple commonsense
grounds, not as a reformer. Both praise good old times, but
Horace without the faintest suggestion of possible revival of them, or
anything like them. Both refer to the beginnings of civilization, but
Vergil looks back to a golden age of primitive communism, when <i>in
medium quaerebant</i> and so forth; a state of things ended by Jove’s
ordinance that man should raise himself by toil. Horace, less convinced
of the superiority of the past, depicts<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> the noble savage as having to
fight for every thing, even acorns; and traces steps, leading eventually
to law and order, by which he became less savage and more noble.
Horace is nearer to Lucretius here than Vergil is. Neither could ignore
the disturbing effect of the disbanding of armies and ejectment of
farmers to make way for the settlement of rude soldiers on the land.
But to Horace, personally unconcerned, a cool view was more possible.
So, while hinting at public uneasiness<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> as to the detailed intentions of
the new ruler in this matter, he is able to look at the policy in general
merely as the restoration of weary veterans to a life of peace and the
relief of their chief’s anxieties. Vergil, himself a sufferer, had his little
fling in the <i>Bucolics</i>, and was silent<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> in the <i>Georgics</i>. Again, Vergil
shuns the function of war as a means of supplying the slave-market.
He knows it well enough, and as a feature of the ‘heroic’ ages the fate
of the captive appears in the <i>Aeneid</i>. Horace makes no scruple<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> of
stating the time-honoured principle that a captive is to the conqueror
a valuable asset: there is a market for him as a serviceable drudge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
and not to spare his life is sheer waste. That there may be sarcasm
underlying the passage does not impair its candour. And it distinctly
includes rustic slavery in the words <i>sine pascat durus aretque</i>. Lastly,
while both poets praise the restfulness of the countryside with equal
sincerity, it is Horace who recognizes<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> that the working farmer himself,
after his long labours at the plough, looks forward to retirement
and ease when he has saved enough to live on. His is a real rustic,
Vergil’s an ideal.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that all writers are, as sources of evidence, at
their best when they feel free to say or to leave unsaid this or that
according to their own judgment. If there is in the background some
other person whom it is necessary to please, it is very hard to divine
the reason of an author’s frankness, and still more of his reticence.
For instance, the omission of a topic naturally connected with a subject
need not imply that a patron forbade its introduction. I cannot believe
that such a man as Maecenas<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> banned the free mention of slavery in
the <i>Georgics</i>. But, if a whole subject is proposed for treatment under
conditions of a well-understood tendency, the writer is not unlikely to
discover that artistic loyalty to that tendency will operate to render
the introduction of this or that particular topic a matter of extreme
difficulty. If the task of Vergil was to recommend a return to a more
wholesome system of agriculture, reference to the labour-question
or to land-tenure bristled with difficulties. My belief is that the poet
shirked these topics, relevant though they surely were, because he did
not see how to treat them without provoking controversy or ill-feeling;
a result which Maecenas and the Emperor were undoubtedly anxious
to avoid. It was simpler and safer not to refer to these things. True,
the omission was a restraint on full-blooded realism. An indistinct
picture was produced, and modern critics have some reason to complain
of the difficulty of understanding many places of the <i>Georgics</i>.</p>

<p>Whether chronological considerations may throw any light on the
influences to which this indistinctness is due, and, if so, what is their
exact significance, are very difficult questions, to which I cannot offer
a definite answer. The completion of the <i>Georgics</i> is placed in the
year 30 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, after seven years more or less spent on composition and
revision. Now it was in that year that the new ruler, supreme since
the overthrow of Antony, organized the great disbandment of armies
of which he speaks in the famous inscription<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> recording the events of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
his career. He tells us that he rewarded all the discharged men,
either with assignations of land or with sums of money in lieu thereof.
The lands were bought by him (not confiscated) and the money-payments
also were at his cost (<i>a me dedi</i>). Below he refers to
the matter again, and adds that to pay for lands taken and assigned
to soldiers was a thing no one had ever done before. That he paid
in all cases, and paid the full market value, he does not expressly
say; Mommsen shews cause for doubting it. The only remark I have
to make is that in the years between Philippi and Aetium there was
plenty of fighting and negotiations. Maecenas was for most of the
time in a position of great trust, and pretty certainly in touch with all
that went on. The fact that a wholesale discharge of soldiers was
surely coming, and that the future of agriculture in Italy was doubtful,
was perhaps not likely to escape the forecast of so far-sighted a man.
Is it just possible that Vergil may have had a hint from him, to stick
to generalities and avoid controversial topics? We are credibly informed<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>
that Maecenas was well rewarded by his master for his valuable
services, and it has been pointed out<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> that his position of authority
offered many opportunities of profitable transactions on his own account.
There is even an express tradition that he was concerned in the
liquidation of one estate. In short, he was one of the land-speculators
of the time. To such a man it would seem not untimely to praise the
virtues of the rustic Romans of old and to recommend their revival in
the coming age; but to call attention to the uncertainties of the present,
involving many awkward problems, would seem imprudent. In suggesting,
doubtfully, that a patron’s restraining hand may have had
something to do with the poet’s reticence, I may be exaggerating the
pressure exercised by the one on the other. But that Maecenas interested
himself in the slowly-growing poem is hardly to be doubted. Early
in each of the four books he is addressed by name. His <i>haud mollia
iussa</i> (<span class="allsmcap">III</span> 41) may imply nothing more than the general difficulty of
Vergil’s task: but may it not faintly indicate just the least little restiveness
under a guidance that could not be refused openly?</p>

<p>To reject the suggestion of actual interference on Maecenas’ part
is not to say that the <i>Georgics</i> exhibits no deference to his wishes.
That many a veiled hint could be given by a patron in conversation
is obvious. That Maecenas would be a master of that judicious art,
is probable from what we know of his character and career. But, while
it is plain that questions of land-tenure would from his point of view
be better ignored, how would his likes and dislikes affect the mention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
of slavery and the labour-question? Here I must refer to the three
great writers on agriculture. Cato, about 150 years earlier, and Columella,
about 80 years later, both contemplate the actual buying of
land, and insist on the care necessary in selection. The contemporary
Varro seems certainly to assume purchase. All three deal with slave-labour,
Cato like a hard-fisted <i>dominus</i> of an old-Roman generation
just become consciously imperial and bent on gain, Columella as a
skilful organizer of the only regular supply of labour practically available:
Varro, who makes more allowance<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> for free labour beside that
of slaves, reserves the free man for important jobs, where he may be
trusted to use his wits, or for unhealthy work, in which to risk slaves
is to risk your own property. All the ordinary work in his system is
done by slaves. The contemporary Livy<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> tells us that in his time large
districts near Rome had scarce any free inhabitants left. The elder
Pliny, reckoning up the advantages of Italy for the practice of agriculture,
includes<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> among them the supply of <i>servitia</i>, though no man knew
better than he what fatal results had issued from the plantation-system.
It is to be borne in mind that this evidence relates to the plains and
the lower slopes of hills, that is to the main agricultural districts. It
is to these parts that Gardthausen<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> rightly confines his remarks on the
desolation of Italy, which began before the civil wars and was accelerated
by them. Other labour was scarce, and gangs of slaves, generally
chained, were almost the only practicable means of tillage for profit.
Speaking broadly, I think the truth of this picture is not to be denied.
If then the word had gone forth that a return to smaller-scale farming
was to be advocated as a cure for present evils, it was hardly possible
to touch on slavery without some unfavourable reference to the plantation-system.
Now surely it is most unlikely that Maecenas, a cool
observer and a thorough child of the age, sincerely believed in the
possibility of setting back the clock. The economic problem could
not be solved so simply, by creating a wave of ‘back-to-the-land’
enthusiasm. I suggest that he saw no good to be got by openly
endeavouring to recreate the race of small working farmers by artificial
means. Would it be wise to renew an attempt in which the Gracchi
had failed? Now to Vergil, who had passed his youth in a district of
more humane agriculture, the mere praise of farming, with its rich
compensations for never-ending toil and care, would be a congenial
theme. The outcome of their combination was that a topic not easily
idealized in treatment was omitted. The realistic value of the picture
was impaired to the relief of both poet and patron. But what the poem
gained as a beautiful aspiration it lost as a practical authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>Can we suppose that Vergil did not know how important a place
in contemporary agriculture was filled by slave-labour? I think not:
surely it is inconceivable. What meets us at every turn in other writers
cannot have been unknown to him. Macrobius<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> has preserved for us
a curious record belonging to 43 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, when the great confiscations and
assignations of land were being carried out in the Cisalpine by order
of the Triumvirs. Money and arms, needed for the coming campaign
of Philippi, were being requisitioned at the same time. The men of
property threatened by these exactions hid themselves. Their slaves
were offered rewards and freedom if they would betray their masters’
hiding-places, but not one of them yielded to the temptation. The
commander who made the offer was Pollio. No doubt domestics are
chiefly meant, but there were rustic slaves, and we have reason to
think that they were humanely treated in those parts. Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>
tells us that in 41 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> Octavian, under great pressure from the clamorous
armies, saw nothing to be done but to take all Italian lands from present
owners and hand them over to the soldiers μετά τε τῆς δουλείας
καὶ μετὰ τῆς ἄλλης κατασκευῆς. Circumstances necessitated compromise,
which does not concern us here. But it is well to remember that it
was just the best land that the soldiers wanted, and with it slaves and
other farm-stock. For it was a pension after service, not a hard life
of bodily drudgery, that was in view. The plan of letting the former
owner stay on as a tenant has been referred to above.</p>

<p>I hold then that Vergil’s silence on the topics to which I have
called attention, however congenial it may have been to him, was intentional:
and that the poem, published <i>in honorem Maecenatis</i><a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>, was
limited as to its practical outlook with the approval, if not at the
suggestion, of the patron. It is essentially a literary work. In it
Vergil’s power of gathering materials from all quarters and fusing them
into a whole of his own creation is exemplified to a wonderful degree.
His own deep love of the country, with its homely sights and sounds,
phenomena of a Nature whose laws he felt unable to explore, helped
him to execute the task of recommending a social and economic reform
through the medium of poetry. By ignoring topics deemed unsuitable,
he left his sympathies and enthusiasm free course, and without sympathies
and enthusiasm the <i>Georgics</i> would not have been immortal.
Even when digressing from agriculture, as in his opening address to the
Emperor, there is more sincerity than we are at first disposed to grant.
He had not been a Republican, like Horace, and probably had been
from the first attached to the cause of the Caesars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>I can discover no ground for thinking<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> that Vergil was ever himself
a farmer. That Pliny and Columella cite him as an authority is in
my opinion due to the predominance of his works in the literary world.
As writers of prose dealing with facts often of an uninspiring kind, it
would seem to raise the artistic tone of heavy paragraphs if the first
name in Latin literature could be introduced with an apposite quotation
in agreement with their own context. Vergil-worship began early and
lasted long; and indeed his admirers in the present day are sometimes
so absorbed in finding<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> more and more in what he said that they do
not trouble themselves to ask whether there may not be some significance<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
in his silences. Rightly or wrongly, I am persuaded that this
question ought at least to be asked in connexion with the <i>Georgics</i>.
I have reserved till the last a passage<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> of Seneca, in which he challenges
the authority of Vergil in some points connected with trees, speaking
of him as <i>Vergilius noster, qui non quid verissime sed quid decentissime
diceretur aspexit, nec agricolas docere voluit sed legentes delectare</i>. Now
Seneca was devoted to the works of Vergil, and is constantly quoting
them. He has no prejudice against the poet. The view of the <i>Georgics</i>
set forth in these words implies no literary dispraise, but a refusal to
let poetic excellence give currency to technical errors. Seneca is often
tiresome, but in this matter his criticism is in my opinion sound. In
the matter of labour my contention is not that the poet has inadvertently
erred, but that he has for some reason deliberately dissembled.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXX">XXX. THE ELDER SENECA AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p>The comparatively silent interval, between the Augustan circle and
the new group of writers under Claudius and Nero, furnishes little of
importance. The one writer who stands out as giving us a few scraps
of evidence is the <b>elder Seneca</b>, the earliest of the natives of Spain who
made their mark in Latin literature. But the character of his work,
which consists of examples of the treatment of problem-cases in the
schools of rhetoric, makes him a very peculiar witness. When he tells
us how this or that pleader of note made some point neatly, the words
have their appropriate place in the texture of a particular argument.
Often they contain a fallacious suggestion or a misstatement useful for
the purpose of <i>ex parte</i> advocacy, but having as statements no authority<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
whatever. Still there are a few references of significance and value.
Thus, when the poor man’s son refuses the rich man’s offer to adopt
him, and his own father approves the proposal, one rhetorician made
the young man<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> say ‘Great troops of slaves whom their lord does not
know by sight, and the farm-prisons echoing to the sound of the lash,
have no charm for me: my love for my father is an unbought love.’
Again, a poor man, whose property has been outrageously damaged
by a rich neighbour, protests<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> against the whims of modern luxury.
‘Country districts’ he says ‘that once were the plough-lands of whole
communities are now each worked by a single slave-gang, and the sway
of stewards is wider than the realms of kings.’ Now, we cannot cite
the old rhetorician as an authority on agriculture directly: but he gives
us proof positive that references to estates worked by gangs<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> of slaves,
and the <i>ergastula</i> in which the poor wretches were shut up after the
hours of labour, would not in his time sound strange to Roman audiences.
Another passage<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> touches on a very typical lecture-room theme, an
unnatural son. A father is banished for unintentional homicide. The
law forbids the sheltering and feeding of an exile. But the father contrives
to return and haunt an estate adjoining the main property, now
controlled by his son. The son hears of these visits, flogs the <i>vilicus</i>
for connivance, and compels him to exclude the old man. The piece
is one of which only a brief abstract remains, but there is enough to
shew that, while the gist of it was a casuistic discussion of a moral
problem, it assumes as a matter of course the liability of a trusted slave
to the lash. The faithful and kindly slave is contrasted with the unnatural
son. There are in these curious collections other utterances
indicative of the spread of humanitarian notions. Thus in the piece
first cited<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> above, the poor man’s son in refusing the rich man’s offer of
adoption, as a situation to which he could never accommodate himself,
is made to add ‘If you were selling a favourite slave, you would inquire
whether the buyer was a cruel man.’ Such ideas come from the later
Greek philosophies, chiefly Stoic, the system on which Seneca brought
up his more famous son. In one place<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> we find an echo of an earlier
Greek sentiment, when a rhetorician propounds the doctrine that Fortune
only, not Nature, distinguishes freemen from slaves.</p>

<p>Indeed it is evident, from the many passages that touch on slavery
and expose some of its worst horrors, that the subject was at this time
beginning to attract more general attention than heretofore. And the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
relations of patron and freedman, also discussed in these artificial
school-debates, are a further illustration of this tendency. Milder and
more humane principles were germinating, though as yet they had not
found expression in law. In arguing on a peculiarly revolting case (the
deliberate mutilation of child-beggars) a speaker incidentally refers<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> to
wealthy landowners recruiting their slave-gangs by seizing freemen.
The hearers are supposed to receive this reference to kidnapping as no
exceptional thing extravagantly suggested. We have seen that both
Augustus and Tiberius had to intervene to put down this <i>suppressio</i>.
One little note of interest deserves passing mention. In a discussion on
unequal marriages the question is raised whether even the very highest
desert on a slave’s part could justify a father in taking him as a son-in-law.
A speaker cites the case<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> of Old Cato, who married the daughter
of his own <i>colonus</i>. Here we clearly have the tenant farmer in the
second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> In Plutarch the man appears as a client. Neither
writer makes him a freedman in so many words. But it is probably
the underlying fact. That the daughter was <i>ingenua</i> does not rule out
this supposition.</p>

<p><b>Velleius</b> and <b>Valerius Maximus</b> also belong to the reign of
Tiberius. The former in what remains of his history supplies nothing
to my purpose. Valerius made a collection of anecdotes from Roman
and foreign histories illustrating various virtues and vices, classifying
the examples of good and bad action under heads. They are ‘lifted’
from the works of earlier writers: many are taken from Livy, already
used as a classic quarry. The book is pervaded by tiresome moralizing,
and points of interest are few. There is the story of the farm<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> of
Regulus, of the patriotic refusal<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> of M’ Curius to take more than the
normal seven <i>iugera</i> of land as a reward from the state, of the horny-handed
rustic voter<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> being asked whether he walked on his hands; also
reference to the simple habits of the famous Catos, and a passing remark
that the men of old had few slaves. Those of the above passages
that are of any value at all have been noticed in earlier sections. The
freedman <b>Phaedrus</b> gives us next to nothing in his fables, unless we
care to note the items<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> of a farm-property, <i>agellos pecora villam operarios
boves iumenta et instrumentum rusticum</i>, and a fable specially illustrating
the fact that a master’s eye sees what escapes the notice of the
slave-staff, even of the <i>vilicus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">XXXI. SENECA THE YOUNGER.</h3>

<p>The chief literary figure of the reigns of Claudius and Nero was
<b>L Annaeus Seneca</b>, a son of the rhetorician above referred to, and like
his father born in Spain. His life extended from 4 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> to 65 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. For
the purpose of the present inquiry his surviving works are mainly of
interest as giving us in unmistakeable tones the point of view from
which a man of Stoic principles regarded slavery as a social institution.
The society of imperial Rome, in which he spent most of his life, was
politically dead. To meddle with public affairs was dangerous. Even
a senator needed to walk warily, for activity was liable to be misinterpreted
by the Emperor and by his powerful freedmen<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>, who were in
effect Imperial Ministers. To keep on good terms with these departmental
magnates, who had sprung from the slave-market to be courted
as the virtual rulers of freeborn Roman citizens, was necessary for all
men of note. Under such conditions it is not wonderful that the wealthy
were tempted to assert themselves in ostentatious luxury and dissipation:
for a life of careless debauchery was on the face of it hardly
compatible with treasonable conspiracy. The immense slave-households
of Rome were a part and an expression of this extravagance; and the
fashion of these domestic armies was perhaps at its height in this period.
Now, nothing kept the richer Romans in subjection more efficiently
than this habit of living constantly exposed to the eyes and ears of
their menials. Cruel laws might protect the master from assassination
by presuming<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> the guilt of all slaves who might have prevented it.
They could not protect him from the danger of criminal charges, such
as treason<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>, supported by servile evidence: indeed the slave was a
potential informer, and a hated master was at the mercy of his slaves.
Under some Emperors this possibility was a grim reality, and no higher
or more heartfelt praise could be bestowed<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> on an Emperor than that
he refused to allow masters to be done to death by the tongue of their
slaves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the slave was still legally<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> his (or her) master’s chattel,
and cases of revolting cruelty<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> and other abominations occurred from
time to time. Yet more humane and sympathetic views were already
affecting public sentiment, chiefly owing to the spread of Stoic doctrines
among the cultivated classes. Of these doctrines as adapted to Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
minds Seneca was the leading preacher. Thus he cites the definition
of ‘slave’ as ‘wage-earner for life,’ propounded<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> by Chrysippus: he
insists on the human quality common to slave and free alike: he reasserts
the equality of human rights, only upset by Fortune, who has
made one man master of another: he sees that the vices of slaves are
very often simply the result of the misgovernment of their owners: he
reckons them as humble members<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> of the family circle, perhaps even
the former playmates of boyhood: he recommends a kindly consideration
for a slave’s feelings, and admits<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> that some sensitive natures would
prefer a flogging to a box on the ear or a harsh and contemptuous
scolding. We need not follow up his doctrines in more detail. The
general tone is evident and significant enough. But it is the relations
of the domestic circle that he has primarily in view. His references to
agriculture and rustic labour are few, as we might expect from the circumstances
of his life. But we are in a better position to judge their
value having considered his attitude towards slavery in general. It
should be noted, as a specimen of his tendency to Romanize Greek
doctrine, that he lays great stress on the more wholesome relations<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> of
master and slave in the good old times of early Rome,—here too without
special reference to the rustic households of the rude forefathers round
which tradition centred.</p>

<p>Judged by a modern standard, a defect in Stoic principles was the
philosophic aloofness from the common interests and occupations of
ordinary workaday life. To the Wise Man all things save Virtue are
more or less indifferent, and in the practice of professions and trades
there is little or no direct connexion with Virtue. Contempt for manual
labour, normal in the ancient world and indeed in all slaveowning
societies, took a loftier position under the influence of Stoicism. Hence
that system, in spite of its harsh and tiresome features, appealed to
many of the better Romans of the upper class, seeming as it did to
justify their habitual disdain. Seneca’s attitude towards handicrafts is
much the same as Cicero’s, only with a touch of Stoic priggishness
added. Wisdom, he says<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>, is not a mere handworker (<i>opifex</i>) turning
out appliances for necessary uses. Her function is more important: her
craft is the art of living, and over other arts she is supreme. The quality
of an artist’s action<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> depends on his motive: the sculptor may make a
statue for money or to win fame or as a pious offering. Arts, as Posidonius<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>
said, range from the ‘liberal’ ones to the ‘common and mean’
ones practised by handworkers: the latter have no pretence of moral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
dignity. Indeed many of these trades are quite unnecessary, the outcome
of modern<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> extravagance. We could do without them, and be all
the better for it: man’s real needs are small. But to work for a living
is not in itself a degradation: did not the Stoic master Cleanthes draw
water<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> for hire? In short, the Wise Man may be a king or a slave,
millionaire or pauper. The externals cannot change his true quality,
though they may be a help or a hindrance in his growth to perfect
wisdom.</p>

<p>In his references to agriculture and country matters it is to be
remarked that Seneca confirms the impression derived from other
sources, that the letting of land to tenant farmers was on the increase.
Discoursing on the greedy luxury of the rich, their monstrous kitchens
and cellars, and the toiling of many to gratify the desires of one, he
continues ‘Look at all the places where the earth is being tilled, and
at all the thousands<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> of farmers (<i>colonorum</i>) ploughing and digging; is
this, think you, to be reckoned one man’s belly, for whose service crops
are being raised in Sicily and in Africa too?’ The <i>coloni</i> here mentioned
may be merely ‘cultivators’ in a general sense. But I think they are
more probably tenants of holdings on great estates. In speaking of
his arrival at his Alban villa, and finding nothing ready for a meal, he
philosophically refuses to let so small an inconvenience make him
angry with his cook and his baker. ‘My baker<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> has got no bread; but
the steward has some, and so have the porter and the farmer.’ A
coarse sort of bread, no doubt, but you have only got to wait, and you
will enjoy it when you are really hungry. Here we seem to have an
instance of what was now probably an ordinary arrangement: the <i>villa</i>,
homestead with some land round it, kept as a country ‘box’ for the
master by his steward, who would see to the garden and other appurtenances,
while the rest of the land is let to a humble tenant farmer.
In another passage we have an interesting glimpse of a tenant’s legal
position<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> as against his landlord. ‘If a landlord tramples down growing
crops or cuts down plantations, he cannot keep his tenant, though the
lease may be still in being: this is not because he has recovered what
was due to him as lessor, but because he has made it impossible for
him to recover it. Even so it often happens that a creditor is cast in
damages to his debtor, when he has on other grounds taken from him
more than the amount of the debt claimed.’ I gather from this passage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
that damage done by the lessor to the lessee’s interest in the farm deprived
him of right of action against the lessee, in case he wanted to
enforce some claim (for rent or for some special service) under the
terms of the existing contract<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> of lease. If this inference be just, the
evidence is important. For the <i>colonus</i> is conceived as a humble person,
whose interest a brutal inconsiderate landlord would be not unlikely
to disregard, and to whom a resort to litigation would seem a course
to be if possible avoided.</p>

<p>To this question of the rights of landlord and tenant Seneca returns
later, when engaged in reconciling the Stoic thesis that ‘all things
belong to the Wise Man’ with the facts of actual life. The Wise Man
is in the position of a King to whom belongs the general right of
sovranty (<i>imperium</i>) while his subjects have the particular right of
ownership (<i>dominium</i>). Illustrating the point he proceeds<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> thus. ‘Say
I have hired a house from you. Of its contents some belong to you and
some to me. The thing (<i>res</i>) is your property, but the right of user
(<i>usus</i>) of your property is mine. Just so you must not meddle with
crops, though grown on your own estate, if your tenant forbids it; and
in a season of dearness or dearth you will be like the man in Vergil
wistfully gazing at another’s plenteous store, though the land where it
grew, the yard where it is stacked, and the granary it is meant to fill,
are all your own property. Nor, when I have hired a lodging, have
you a right to enter it, owner though you be: when a slave of yours is
hired for service by me, you have no right to withdraw him: and, if I
hire a trap from you and give you a lift, it will be a good turn on my
part, though the conveyance belongs to you.’ I have quoted this at
some length, in order to make the farm-tenant’s position quite clear.
His rights are presumed to be easily ascertainable, and his assertion of
them will be protected by the law. His contract, whether a formal
lease or not, is also presumed to guarantee him complete control of the
subject for the agreed term. Whether encroachments by landlords and
legal proceedings for redress by tenants were common events in rural
Italy, Seneca need not and does not say. I suspect that personal interest
on both sides was in practice a more effective restraint than
appeals to law.</p>

<p>There are other references to agricultural conditions, which though
of less importance are interesting as confirming other evidence as to
the <i>latifundia</i> of this period. A good specimen is found in his denunciation
of human greed as the cause of poverty, by bringing to an end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
the happy age of primitive communism, when all shared the ownership
of all. Cramped and unsatisfied, this <i>avaritia</i> can never find the
way back to the old state of plenty and happiness. ‘Hence, though
she now endeavour to make good<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> what she has wasted; though she
add field to field by buying out her neighbours or wrongfully ejecting
them; though she expand her country estates on the scale of provinces,
and enjoy the sense of landlordism in the power of touring
mile after mile without leaving her own domains; still no enlargement
of bounds will bring us back to the point from whence we started.’
Again, in protesting against the luxurious ostentation of travellers and
others, he shews that they are really in debt. ‘So-and-so is, you fancy,
a rich man ... because he has arable estates<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> in all provinces of the
empire ... because his holding of land near Rome is on a scale one
would grudge him even in the wilds of Apulia.’ Such a man is in debt
to Fortune. In these as in other passages the preacher illustrates his
sermon by references calculated to bring home his points. Naturally
he selects for the purpose matters familiar to his audience; and it is
this alone that makes the passages worth quoting. The same may be
said of his sympathetic reference<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> to the hard lot of a slave transferred
from the easy duties of urban service to the severe toil of farm labour.
In general it may be remarked that the evidence of Seneca and other
literary men of this period is to be taken in connexion with the treatise
of Columella, who is the contemporary specialist on agriculture.
The prevalence of slave labour and the growth of the tenant-farmer
class are attested by both lines of evidence.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">XXXII. LUCAN, PETRONIUS, AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p><b>Lucan</b>, Seneca’s nephew, has a few interesting references in his
poem on the great civil war. Thus, in the eloquent passage<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> lamenting
the decay of Roman vital strength, a long process to be disastrously
completed in the great Pharsalian battle, he dwells on the shrinkage
of free Roman population in Italy. The towns and the countryside
alike are empty, houses deserted, and it is by the labour of chained<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>
slaves that Italian crops are raised. Elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> he looks further back,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
and traces this decay to the effect of luxury and corruption caused by
the influx of vast wealth, the spoils of Roman conquests. Among the
symptoms of disease he notes the <i>latifundia</i>, which it was now becoming
the fashion to denounce, the land-grabbing passion that
prompted men to monopolize great tracts of land and incorporate in
huge estates, worked by cultivators unknown<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> to them, farms that once
had been ploughed and hoed by the rustic heroes of old. But all such
utterances are merely a part of a declaimer’s stock-in-trade. We may
fairly guess that they are echoes of talk heard in the literary circle of
his uncle Seneca. That they are nevertheless consistent with the land-system
of this period, is to be gathered from other sources, such as
Petronius and Columella. It remains to note that the word <i>colonus</i> is
used by Lucan in the senses of ‘cultivator’ and ‘farmer,’ rather suggesting
ownership, and of ‘military colonist,’ clearly implying it. That
of ‘tenant’ does not occur: there was no need for it in the poem.
Again, he has <i>servire servilis</i> and <i>servitium</i>, but <i>servus</i> occurs only in
a suspected<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> line, and as an adjective. His regular word for ‘slave’ is
<i>famulus</i>.</p>

<p>The bucolic poems of this period are too manifestly artificial to
serve as evidence of value. For instance, when <b>Calpurnius</b> declares<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>
that in this blessed age of peace and prosperity the <i>fossor</i> is not afraid
to profit by the treasure he may chance to dig up, we cannot infer that
a free digger is meant, though it is hardly likely that a slave would be
suffered to keep treasure-trove.</p>

<p><b>Petronius</b>, in the curious mixed prose-verse satire of which part has
come down to us, naturally says very little bearing directly on agriculture.
But in depicting the vulgar freedman-millionaire Trimalchio he refers
pointedly to the vast landed estates belonging to this typical figure of
the period. He owns estates ‘far as the kites<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> can fly.’ This impression
is confirmed in detail by a report delivered by the agent for his properties.
It is a statement<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> of the occurrences in a domain of almost
imperial proportions during a single day. So many children, male and
female, were born: so many thousand bushels of wheat were stocked
in the granary: so many hundred oxen broken in: a slave was crucified
for disloyalty to his lord: so many million sesterces were paid in to the
chest, no opening for investment presenting itself. On one park-estate
(<i>hortis</i>) there was a great fire, which began in the steward’s house.
Trimalchio cannot recall the purchase of this estate, which on inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
turns out to be a recent acquisition not yet on the books. Then comes
the reading of notices issued by officials<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> of the manors, of wills<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>
    made
by rangers, of the names of his stewards; of a freedwoman’s divorce,
the banishment of an <i>atriensis</i>, the committal of a cashier for trial,
and the proceedings in court in an action between some chamberlains.
Of course all this is not to be taken seriously, but we can form some
notion of the state of things that the satirist has in mind. Too gross
an exaggeration would have defeated his purpose. The book is full of
passages bearing on the history of slavery, but it is domestic slavery,
and that often of the most degrading character.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">XXXIII. COLUMELLA.</h3>

<p>The great interest taken in agriculture after the establishment of
the Roman peace by Augustus is shewn by the continued appearance
of works on the subject. The treatise of <b>Celsus</b>, who wrote in the time
of Tiberius, was part of a great encyclopaedic work. It was probably
one of the most important books of its kind: but it is lost, and we only
know it as cited by other writers, such as Columella and the elder
Pliny. It is from the treatise of <b>Columella</b>, composed probably under
Nero, that we get most of our information as to Roman husbandry
(<i>rusticatio</i>, as he often calls it) in the period of the earlier Empire. The
writer was a native of Spain, deeply interested, like other Spanish
Romans, in the past present and future of Italy. It is evident that in
comparing the present with the past he could not avoid turning an
uneasy eye to the future. Like others, he could see that agriculture,
once the core of Roman strength, the nurse of a vigorous free population,
was in a bad way. It was still the case that the choicest farm-lands
of Italy were largely occupied by mansions and parks, the
property of non-resident owners who seldom visited their estates, and
hardly ever qualified themselves to superintend their management intelligently.
The general result was hideous waste. In modern language,
those who had command of capital took no pains to employ it in
business-like farming: while the remaining free rustics lacked capital.
Agriculture was likely to go from bad to worse under such conditions.
The Empire would thus be weakened at its centre, and to a loyal Provincial,
whose native land was part of a subject world grouped round
that centre, the prospect might well seem bewildering. Columella was
from the first interested in agriculture, on which his uncle<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> at Gades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
(Cadiz) was a recognized authority, and his treatise <i>de re rustica</i> is his
contribution to the service of Rome.</p>

<p>The serious consequences of the decay of practical farming, and
the disappearance of the small landowners tilling their own land, had
long been recognized by thoughtful men. But the settlement of discharged
soldiers on allotted holdings had not repopulated the countryside
with free farmers. The old lamentations continued, but no means
was found for solving the problem how to recreate a patient and prosperous
yeoman class, firmly planted on the soil. Technical knowledge
had gone on accumulating to some extent, though the authorities on
agriculture, Greek Carthaginian or Roman, appealed to by Columella
are mainly the same as those cited by Varro some eighty years before.
The difficulty at both epochs was not the absence of knowledge but
the neglect of its practical application. Columella, like his forerunners,
insists on the folly<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> of buying more land than you can profitably
manage. But it seems that the average wealthy landowner could not
resist the temptation to round off<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> a growing estate by buying up
more land when a favourable opportunity occurred. It is even hinted
that ill-treatment<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> of a neighbour, to quicken the process by driving
him to give up his land, was not obsolete. Moreover, great estates
often consisted of separate holdings in different parts of the country.
For owners of vast, and sometimes<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> scattered, estates to keep effective
control over them was an occupation calling for qualities never too
common, technical skill and indefatigable industry. The former could,
if combined with perfect honesty, be found in an ideal deputy; but
the deputy, to be under complete control, must be a slave: and, the
more skilled the slave, the better able he was to conceal dishonesty.
Therefore, the more knowledge and watchful attentiveness was needed
in the master. Now it is just this genuine and painstaking interest
in the management of their estates that Columella finds lacking in
Roman landlords. They will not live<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> in the country, where they
are quickly bored and miss the excitements of the city, and My Lady
detests country life even more than My Lord. But they will not even
take the trouble to procure good<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> Stewards, let alone watching them
so as to keep them industrious and honest. Thus the management
of estates has generally passed from masters to <i>vilici</i>, and the domestic
part of the duties even more completely from house-mistresses to <i>vilicae</i>.
As to the disastrous effect of the change upon rustic economy, the
writer entertains no doubt. But the evil was no new phenomenon. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
may well be that it was now more widespread than in Varro’s time;
but in both writers we may perhaps suspect some degree of overstatement,
to which reformers are apt to resort in depicting the abuses
they are wishing to reform. I do not allow much for this consideration,
for the picture, confirmed by general literary evidence, is in the main
unquestionably true.</p>

<p>So much for the case of estates administered by slave stewards for
the account of their masters. But this was not the only way of dealing
with landed properties. We have already noted the system of letting
farms to cultivating tenants, and commented on the fewness of the
references to it in literature. This plan may have been very ancient
in origin, but it was probably an exceptional arrangement even in the
time of Cicero. The very slight notice of it by Varro indicates that it
was not normal, indeed not even common. In Columella we find a
remarkable change. In setting out the main principles<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> of estate
management, and insisting on the prime importance of the owner’s
attention (<i>cura domini</i>), he adds that this is necessary above all things
in relation to the persons concerned (<i>in hominibus</i>). Now the <i>homines</i>
are <i>coloni</i> or <i>servi</i>, and are unchained or chained. After this division
and subdivision he goes on to discuss briefly but thoroughly the proper
relations between landlord and tenant-farmer, the care needed in the
selection of satisfactory tenants, and the considerations that must guide
a landlord in deciding whether to let a piece of land to a tenant or to
farm it for his own account. He advises him to be obliging and easy
in his dealings with tenants, and more insistent in requiring their work
or service (<i>opus</i>)<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> than their rent (<i>pensiones</i>): this plan is less irritating,
and after all it pays better in the long run. For, barring risks of storms
or brigands, good farming nearly always leaves a profit, so that the
tenant has not the face to claim<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> a reduction of rent. A landlord
should not be a stickler for trifles or mean in the matter of little perquisites,
such as cutting firewood, worrying his tenant unprofitably.
But, while waiving the full rigour of the law, he should not omit to
claim his dues in order to keep alive his rights: wholesale remission
is a mistake. It was well said by a great landowner that the greatest
blessing for an estate is when the tenants are natives<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> of the place, a
sort of hereditary occupiers, attached to it by the associations of their
childhood’s home. Columella agrees that frequent changes of tenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
are a bad business. But there is a worse; namely the town-bred<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>
tenant, who prefers farming with a slave staff to turning farmer himself.
It was a saying of Saserna, that out of a fellow of this sort you
generally get not your rent but a lawsuit. His advice then was, take
pains to get country-bred farmers<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> and keep them in permanent
tenancy: that is, when you are not free to farm your own land, or
when it does not suit your interest to farm it with a slave staff. This
last condition, says Columella, only refers to the case of lands derelict<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>
through malaria or barren soil.</p>

<p>There are however farms on which it is the landlord’s own interest
to place tenants rather than work them by slaves for his own account.
Such are distant holdings, too out-of-the-way for the proprietor to visit
them easily. Slaves out of reach of constant inspection will play havoc
with any farm, particularly one on which corn is grown. They let out
the oxen for hire, neglect the proper feeding of live stock, shirk the
thorough turning of the earth, and in sowing tending harvesting and
threshing the crop they waste and cheat you to any extent. No
wonder the farm gets a bad name thanks to your steward and staff.
If you do not see your way to attend in person to an estate of this kind,
you had better let it to a tenant. From these remarks it seems clear
that the writer looks upon letting land to tenant farmers as no more
than an unwelcome alternative, to be adopted only in the case of farms
bad in quality or out of easy reach. Indeed he says frankly that, given
fair average conditions, the owner can always get better returns by
managing a farm himself than by letting it to a tenant: he may even
do better by leaving the charge to a steward, unless of course that
steward happens to be an utterly careless or thievish fellow. Taking
this in connexion with his remarks about stewards elsewhere, the net
result seems to be that a landlord must choose in any given case what
he judges to be the less of two evils.</p>

<p>A few points here call for special consideration. In speaking of
the work or service (<i>opus</i>) that a landlord may require of a tenant, as
distinct from rent, what does Columella precisely mean? It has been
held<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> that he refers to the landlord’s right of insisting that his land
shall be well farmed. This presumably implies a clause in the lease
under which such a right could be enforced. But there are difficulties.
In the case of a distant farm, let to a tenant because it has ‘to do
without the presence<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> of the landlord,’ the right would surely be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
inoperative in practice. In the case of a neighbouring farm, why has the
landlord not kept it in hand, putting in a steward to manage it? This
interpretation leaves us with no clear picture of a practical arrangement.
But this objection is perhaps not fatal. The right to enforce
proper cultivation is plainly guaranteed to landlords in Roman Law,
as the jurists constantly assert in discussing tenancies. And <i>opus</i> is a
term employed<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> by them in this connexion. It is therefore the safer
course to take it here in this sense, and to allow for a certain want of
clearness in Columella’s phrase. At the same time it is tempting to
accept another<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> view, namely this, that the writer has in mind service
rendered in the form of a stipulated amount of auxiliary labour on
the landlord’s ‘Home Farm’ at certain seasons. That a <i>corvée</i> arrangement
of this kind existed as a matter of course on some estates, we
have direct evidence<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> in the second century, evidence that suggests an
earlier origin for the custom. True, it implies that landlords were in
practice able to impose the burden of such task-work on their free
tenants, in short that they had the upper hand in the bargain between
the parties. But this is not surprising: for we read<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> of a great landlord
calling up his <i>coloni</i> to serve on his private fleet in the great civil war,
a hundred years before Columella. Still, it is perhaps rash to see in
this passage a direct reference to the custom of making the supply of
auxiliary labour at certain seasons a part of tenant’s obligations.
Granting this, it is nevertheless reasonable to believe that the first
beginnings of the custom may belong to a date at least as early as
the treatise of Columella. For it is quite incredible that such a practice
should spring up and become prevalent suddenly. It has all the marks
of gradual growth.</p>

<p>Another point of interest is the criticism of the town-bred <i>colonus</i>.
He prefers to work the farm with a slave staff, rather than undertake
the job himself. I gather from this that he is a man with capital, also
that he means to get a good return on his capital. He fears to make
a loss on a rustic venture, being well aware of his own inexperience.
So he will put in a steward with a staff of slaves. The position of the
steward will in such a case be peculiarly strong. If he is slack and
thievish and lets down the farm, he can stave off his master’s anger
by finding fault with the soil or buildings, and involve the tenant and
landlord in a quarrel over the rent. To devise pretexts would be easy
for a rogue, and a quarrel might end in a lawsuit. That Saserna, writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
probably about 100 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, laid his finger on this possible source of trouble,
is significant. It is evidence that there were tenant-farmers in his time,
and bad ones among them: but not that they were then numerous,
or that their general character was such as to make landlords let their
estates in preference to managing them through their own stewards
for their own account. And this agrees with Columella’s own opinion
some 150 years later. If you are to let farms to tenants, local men
who are familiar with local conditions are to be preferred, but he gives
no hint that such tenants could readily be found. His words seem
rather to imply that they were rare.</p>

<p>One point is hardly open to misunderstanding. In Columella’s
system the typical tenant-farmer, the <i>colonus</i> to be desired by a wise
landlord, is a humble person, to whom small perquisites are things of
some importance. He is not a restless or ambitious being, ever on the
watch for a chance of putting his landlord in the wrong or a pretext
for going to law. Such as we see him in the references of Seneca, and
later in those of the younger Pliny and Martial, such he appears in
Columella. For the landlord it is an important object to keep him—when
he has got him—and to have his son ready as successor in the
tenancy. From other sources we know<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> that the value of long undisturbed
tenancies are generally recognized. But we have little or
nothing to shew whether the tenant-farmers of this age usually worked
with their own hands or not. That they employed slave labour is not
only <i>a priori</i> probable, but practically certain. We have evidence that
at a somewhat later date it was customary<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> for the landlord to provide
land farmstead (<i>villa</i>) and equipment (<i>instrumentum</i>), and we know that
under this last head slaves could be and were concluded. It is evident
that the arrangement belongs to the decisive development of the
tenancy system as a regular alternative to that of farming by a steward
for landlord’s own account. The desirable country-bred tenant would
not be a man<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> of substantial capital, and things had to be made easy
for him. It is not clear that a tenant bringing his own staff of slaves
would have been welcomed as lessee: from the instance of the town-bred
<i>colonus</i> just referred to it seems likely that he would not.</p>

<p>While Columella prescribes letting to tenants as the best way of
solving the difficulties in dealing with outlying farms, he does not say
that this plan should not be adopted in the case of farms near the main
estate or ‘Home Farm.’ I think this silence is intentional. It is hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
to believe that there were no instances of landlords either wholly non-resident
or who so seldom visited their estates that they could not
possibly keep an eye on the doings of stewards. In such cases there
would be strong inducement to adopt the plan by which they could
simply draw rents and have no stewards to look after. That stewards
needed to be carefully watched was as clear to Columella as to Cato
or Varro. True, letting to tenants was a policy liable to bring troubles
of its own. We shall see in the case of the younger Pliny what they
were and how he met them. Meanwhile he may serve as an example
of the system. It is also plain that a large continuous property could
be divided<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> into smaller parcels for convenience of letting to tenants.
Whether the later plan of keeping a considerable Home Farm in hand
under a steward, and letting off the outer parcels of the same estate to
tenants, was in vogue already and contemplated by Columella, is not
easy to say. In connexion with this question it is to be noted that he
hardly refers at all to free hired labour<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> as generally available. The
migratory gangs of wage-earners, still known to Varro, do not appear,
nor do the itinerant <i>medici</i>. When he speaks of hiring hands at any
price, or of times when labour is cheap, he may mean hiring somebody’s
slaves, and probably does. Slave labour is undoubtedly the basis of
his farm-system, and its elaborate organization fills an important part
of his book. Yet two marked consequences of the Roman Peace had
to be taken into account. Fewer wars meant fewer slaves in the market,
and a rise of prices: peace and law in Italy meant that big landowners
could add field to field more securely than ever, while great numbers
of citizens were settling in the Provinces, taking advantage of better
openings<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> there. To keep some free labour within call as an occasional
resource was an undeniable convenience for a large owner with a farm
in hand. Small tenants<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> under obligation to render stipulated service
at certain seasons would obviously supply the labour needed. And, if
we picture to ourselves a Home Farm round the lord’s mansion, worked
by steward and slave staff, with outlying ‘soccage’ tenants on holdings
near, we are already in presence of a rudimentary Manor. As time
went by, and the system got into regular working order, the landlord
had an opportunity of strengthening his hold on the tenants. By not
pressing them too severely for arrears of rent, and occasionally granting
abatements, he could gradually increase their services. What he thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
saved on his own labour-bill might well be more than a set-off against
the loss of money-rents. More and more the tenants would become
dependent on him. Nominally free, they were becoming tied to the
soil on onerous terms, and the foundation was laid of the later relation
of Lord and Serf.</p>

<p>Such I conceive to be the rustic situation the beginnings of which
are probably to be placed as early as Columella’s time, though we do
not find him referring to it. He says nothing of another point, which
was of importance<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> later, namely the admission of slaves or freedmen
as tenants of farms. It has all the appearance of a subsequent step,
taken when the convenience of services rendered by resident tenants
had been demonstrated by experience. It is no great stretch of imagination
to suggest that, as the supply of slaves fell off, it was the policy
of owners to turn their slave-property to the best possible account.
When a steward or a gang-foreman was no longer in his prime, able
(as Columella enjoins) to turn to and shew the common hands how
work should be done, how could he best be utilized? A simple plan
was to put him on a small farm with a few slave labourers. This would
secure the presence of a tenant whose dependence was certain from
the first, while a younger man could be promoted to the arduous duties
of the big Home Farm. Be this as it may, it is certain that problems
arising from shortage of slaves were presenting themselves in the
middle of the first century <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. For slave-breeding, casual in Cato’s
day and incidentally mentioned by Varro, is openly recognized by
Columella, who allows for a larger female element in his farm staff and
provides rewards for their realized fertility.</p>

<p>If the system of farm-tenancies was already becoming a part of
land-management so important as the above remarks may seem to
imply, why does the management of a landed estate for landlord’s
account under a steward occupy almost the whole of Columella’s long
treatise? I think there are several reasons. First, it is management of
tillage-crops and gardens and live stock with which he is chiefly concerned,
not tenures and labour-questions: and technical skill in agriculture
is of interest to all connected with it, though the book is
primarily addressed to landlords. Secondly, the desirable tenant was
(and is) a man not much in need of being taught his business: as for
an undesirable one, the sooner he is got rid of the better. Thirdly, the
plan of steward-management was still the normal one: the only pity
was that the indolence of owners led to appointment of bad stewards
and left them too much power. Only sound knowledge can enable
landlords to choose good stewards and check bad management. Seeing
agriculture in a bad way, Columella writes to supply this knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
as Cato Varro and others had done before him. Accordingly he begins
with the general organization of the normal large estate, and first discusses
the choice and duties of the <i>vilicus</i>, on whose character and
competence everything depends. To this subject he returns in a later
part of the treatise, and the two passages<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> enforce the same doctrine
with very slight variations in detail.</p>

<p>The steward<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> must not be a fancy-slave, a domestic from the master’s
town house, but a well-tried hardy rustic, or at the very least one used
to hard labour. He must not be too old, or he may break down under
the strain; nor too young, or the elder slaves will not respect him. He
must be a skilled farmer (this is most important)<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>, or at least thoroughly
painstaking, so as to pick up the business quickly: for the functions of
teaching and giving orders cannot be separated. He need not be able
to read and write, if his memory be very retentive. It is a remark of
Celsus, that a steward of this sort brings his master cash more often
than a book: for he cannot make up false accounts himself, and fears
to trust an accomplice. But, good bad or indifferent, a steward must
have a female partner<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> allotted him, to be a restraining influence on him
and in some respects a help. Being<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> his master’s agent, he must be
enjoined not to live on terms of intimacy with any of the staff, and still
less with any outsider. Yet he may now and then invite a deserving
worker to his table on a feast-day. He must not do sacrifice<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> without
orders, or meddle with divination. He must attend markets only on
strict business, and not gad about, unless it be to pick up wrinkles<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> for
the farm, and then only if the place visited be close at hand. He must
not allow new pathways to be made on the farm, or admit as guests any
but his master’s intimate friends. He must be instructed to attend
carefully<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> to the stock of implements and tools, keeping everything in
duplicate and in good repair, so that there need be no borrowing from
neighbours: for the waste of working time thus caused is a more serious
item than the cost of such articles. He is to see to the clothing<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> of the
staff (<i>familiam</i>) in practical garments that will stand wet and cold:
this done, some work in the open is possible in almost any weather.
He should be not only an expert in farm labour, but a man of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
highest mental and moral character<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> compatible with a slave-temperament.
For his rule should be sympathetic but firm: he should not be
too hard<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> upon the worse hands, while he encourages the better ones,
but aim at being feared for his strictness rather than loathed for harshness.
The way to achieve this is to watch and prevent, not to overlook
and then punish. Even the most inveterate rogues are most effectively
controlled by insisting on performance<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> of their tasks, ensuring them
their due rights, and by the steward being always on the spot. Under
these conditions the various foremen<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> will take pains to carry out their
several duties, while the common hands, tired out, will be more inclined
to go to sleep than to get into mischief. Some good old usages tending
to promote content and good feeling are unhappily gone beyond recall,
for instance<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> the rule that a steward must not employ a fellow-slave’s
services on any business save that of his master. But he must not suffer
them to stray off the estate unless he sends them on errands; and this
only if absolutely necessary. He must not do any trading<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> on his own
account, or employ his master’s cash in purchase of beasts etc. For
this distracts a steward’s attention, and prevents the correct balancing
of his accounts at the audit, when he can only produce goods instead
of money. In general, the first<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> requisite is that he should be free from
conceit and eager to learn. For in farming mistakes can never be
redeemed: time lost is never regained: each thing must be done right,
once for all.</p>

<p>The above is almost a verbal rendering of Columella’s words. At
this point we may fairly pause to ask whether he seriously thought that
an ordinary landlord had much chance of securing such a paragon of
virtue as this pattern steward. That all these high bodily mental and
moral qualities combined in one individual could be bought in one lot
at an auction<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> must surely have been a chance so rare as to be hardly
worth considering as a means of agricultural development. I take it
that the importance of extreme care in selecting the right man, and in
keeping him to his duties, is insisted on as a protest against the culpable
carelessness of contemporary landlords, of which he has spoken severely
above. If, as I believe, in the great majority of cases a new steward
required much instruction as to the details of his duties and as to the
spirit in which he was both to rule the farm-staff and to serve his master,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
surely the part to be played by the master himself<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> was of fundamental
importance: indeed little less so than in the scheme of old Cato. To
Columella I am convinced that his recommendations stood for an ideal
seldom, if ever, likely to be realized. To say this is not to blame the
good man, but rather to hint that his precepts in general must not be
taken as evidence of a state of things then normally to be found existing
on farms. To express aspirations confesses the shortcomings of
achievement.</p>

<p>To return to our author’s precepts. He goes on to tell us of his own
way of treating<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> his farm-hands, remarking that he has not regretted
his kindness. He talks to a rustic slave (provided he is a decent worker)
more often, and more as man to man (<i>familiarius</i>) than he does to a
town slave. It relieves the round of their toil. He even exchanges
pleasantries with them. He discusses new work-projects with the skilled
hands and so tests their abilities: this flatters them, and they are more
ready to work on a job on which they have been consulted. There are
other points of management on which all prudent masters are agreed,
for instance the inspection<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> of the slaves in the lock-up. This is to
ascertain whether they are carefully chained, and the chamber thoroughly
secured, and whether the steward has chained or released any of them
without his master’s knowledge. For he must not be permitted to release
the chained on his own responsibility. The <i>paterfamilias</i> should
be all the more particular in his inquiries as to slaves of this class, to
see that they are dealt with fairly in matters of clothing and rations,
inasmuch as they are under the control<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> of several superiors, stewards
foremen and warders. This position exposes them to unfair treatment,
and they are apt to be more dangerous through resenting harshness
and stinginess. So a careful master should question them as to whether
they are getting<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> their due allowance. He should taste their food and
examine their clothes etc. He should hear and redress grievances,
punish the mutinous, and reward the deserving. Columella then relates<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>
his own policy in dealing with female slaves. When one of them had
reared three or more children she was rewarded: for 3 she was granted a
holiday, for 4 she was manumitted. This is only fair, and it is a substantial
increment<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> to your property. In general, a landlord is enjoined
to observe religious duties, and to inspect the whole estate immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
on his arrival from Town, checking all items carefully. This done
regularly year after year, he will enjoy order and obedience on his estate
in his old age.</p>

<p>Next comes a general statement of the proper classification of the
slave staff according to varieties<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> of function. For departmental foremen
you should choose steady honest fellows, watchfulness and skill
being needed rather than brute strength. The hind or plowman must
be a big man with a big voice, that the oxen may obey him. And the
taller he is the better will he throw his weight on the plough-tail. The
mere unskilled labourer<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> only needs to be fit for continuous hard work.
For instance, in a vineyard you want a thickset type of labourer to
stand the digging etc, and if they are rogues it does not matter much,
as they work in a gang under an overseer (<i>monitore</i><a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>). By the by, a
scamp is generally more quick-witted than the average, and vineyard
work calls for intelligence: this is why chained hands<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> are commonly
employed there. Of course, he adds, an honest man is more efficient
than a rogue, other things being equal: don’t charge me with a preference
for criminals. Another piece of advice is to avoid<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> mixing up the
various tasks performed by the staff on the plan of making every
labourer do every kind of work. It does not pay in farming. Either
what is every one’s business is felt to be nobody’s duty in particular;
or the effort of the individual is credited to the whole of the gang. This
sets him shirking, and yet you cannot single out the offender; and
this sort of thing is constantly happening. Therefore keep plowmen
vineyard-hands and unskilled labourers apart. Then he passes to
numerical<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> divisions. Squads (<i>classes</i>) should be of not more than ten
men each, <i>decuriae</i> as the old name was, that the overseer may keep
his eye on all. By spreading such squads over different parts of a large
farm it is possible to compare results, to detect laziness, and to escape
the irritating unfairness of punishing the wrong men.</p>

<p>The general impression left on a reader’s mind by Columella’s
principles of slave-management is one of strict control tempered by
judicious humanity. It pays not to be harsh and cruel. Whether we
can fairly credit him with disinterested sympathy on grounds of a
common human nature, such as Seneca was preaching, seems to me
very doubtful. That he regarded the slave as a sort of domesticated
animal, cannot so far as I know be gathered from direct statements,
but may be inferred by just implication from his use of the same language
in speaking of slaves and other live stock. Thus we find<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
‘labouring herd,’ and ‘draught-cattle when they are putting in a good
spell of work.’ So too the steward is to drive home his slave-gang at
dusk ‘after the fashion<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> of a first-rate herdsman,’ and on arrival first of
all to attend to their needs ‘like a careful shepherd.’ The motive of this
care is to keep the staff in good working order. Both steward and
stewardess are required to pay great attention to the health of the staff.
Not only are there prescriptions given for treatment of ailments and
injuries, but the slave really stale from overwork is to have a rest; of
course malingering must be checked. For the sick there is a special<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>
sick-room, always kept clean and aired, and the general sanitation of
the farmstead is strictly enforced. This too is dictated by enlightened
self-interest, a part of the general rule<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> that upkeep is as important as
acquisition. The position of the female staff of the farm has also a
bearing on this subject. They do not appear to be numerous, though
perhaps proportionally more so than in the scheme of Varro. The <i>vilica</i>
has a number of maids under her for doing the various house-work<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> and
spinning and weaving. We have already noted the rewards of fertility
on their part. For the production of home-bred slaves (<i>vernae</i>), always
a thing welcomed by proprietors, is most formally recognized by Columella.
Why it needed encouragement may perhaps receive some illustration
from remarks upon the behaviour of certain birds in the matter
of breeding. Thus peafowl do well in places where they can run at
large, and the hens take more pains to rear their chicks, being so to
speak<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> set free from slavery. And other birds there are that will not
breed in captivity. The analogy of these cases to that of human slaves
can hardly have escaped the notice of the writer.</p>

<p>The distinction between the slaves who are chained and those who
are not appears the more striking from Columella’s references to the
lock-up chamber or slave-prison. His predecessors pass lightly over
this matter, but he gives it the fullest recognition. The <i>ergastulum</i>
should be a chamber<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> below ground level, as healthy as you can get,
lighted by a number of slits in the wall so high above the floor as to
be out of a man’s reach. This dungeon is only for the refractory
slaves, chained and constantly inspected. For the more submissive
ones cabins (<i>cellae</i>) are provided in healthy spots near their work but
not so scattered as to make observation difficult. There is even a bath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
house<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a>, which the staff are allowed to use on holidays only: much
bathing is weakening. Whether on an average farm the chained or
unchained slaves are assumed to be the majority is not quite clear;
probably the unchained, to judge by the general tone of the precepts.
But that a lock-up is part of the normal establishment is clear enough.
And it is to be noted that in one passage<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> <i>ergastula</i> are mentioned in
ill-omened juxtaposition with citizens enslaved by their creditors.
Whether it is implied that unhappy debtors were still liable to be
locked up as slaves in creditors’ dungeons as of old, is not easy to say.
Columella is capable of rhetorical flourishes now and then. It is safer
to suppose that he is referring to two forms of slave-labour; first, the
working off arrears of debt<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> by labour of a servile kind; second, the
wholesale slave-gang system suggested by the significant word <i>ergastula</i>.
Or are we to read into it a reference to the kidnapping<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> of wayfarers
which Augustus and Tiberius had striven to put down? Before
we leave the subject of the slave-staff it is well to note that no prospect
of freedom is held out, at least to the males. Fertility, as we have seen,
might lead to manumission of females. But we are not told what use
they were likely to make of their freedom, when they had got it. My
belief is that they stayed on the estate as tolerated humble dependants;
for they would have no other home. Some were natives of the place,
and the imported ones would have lost all touch with their native
lands. Perhaps the care of poultry<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> is a specimen of the various minor
functions in which they could make themselves useful. At all events
they were free from fetters and the lash. And the men too may have
been occasionally manumitted on the same sort of terms. Silence does
not prove a negative. For instance, we hear of <i>peculium</i>, the slave’s
quasi-property, only incidentally<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> as being derived from <i>pecus</i>. Yet we
are not entitled to say that slaves were not free to make savings under
the system of Columella.</p>

<p>Though the <i>vilicus</i> appears in this treatise as the normal head of
the management, there are signs that this was not the last word in
estate-organization. That he is sometimes<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> referred to as being the
landlord’s agent (<i>actor</i>), but usually not, rather suggests that he could
be, and often was, confined to a more restricted sphere of duty, namely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
the purely agricultural superintendence of the farm in hand. This
would make him a mere farm-bailiff, directing operations on the land,
but with little or no responsibility for such matters as finance. And in
a few passages we have mention of a <i>procurator</i>. This term must be
taken in its ordinary sense<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> as signifying the landlord’s ‘attorney’ or
full legal representative. He is to keep an eye on the management,
for instance<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> the threshing-floor, if the master is not at hand. The
position of his quarters indicates his importance: as the steward’s
lodging is to be where he can watch goings-out and comings-in, so
that of the <i>procurator</i> is to be where<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> he can have a near view of the
steward as well as doings in general. Judging from the common practice
of the day, it is probable that he would be a freedman. Now, why
does Columella, after referring to him thus early in the treatise, proceed
to ignore him afterwards? The only reasonable explanation that occurs
to me is that the appointment of such an official would only be necessary
in exceptional cases: in short, that in speaking of a <i>procurator</i> he
implies an unexpressed reservation ‘supposing such a person to be
employed.’ Circumstances that might lead to such an appointment
are not far to seek. The landlord might be abroad for a long time on
public duty or private business. There might be large transactions
pending (purchases, sales, litigation, etc) in connexion with the estate
or neighbourhood; in the case of a very large estate this was not unlikely.
The estate might be one of several owned by the same lord,
and the <i>procurator</i> intermittently resident on one or other as from time
to time required. Or lastly the services of an agent with full legal
powers may have been desirable in dealing with free tenantry. If a
landlord had a number of tenant farmers on his estates, it is most unlikely
that his <i>vilici</i>, slaves as they were, would be able to keep a firm
hand<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> on them: and the fact of his letting his farms surely suggests
that he would not desire to have much rent-collecting or exaction of
services to do himself.</p>

<p>One point in which Columella’s system seems to record a change
from earlier usage may be found in the comparative disuse of letting
out special jobs to contractors. In one passage<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>, when discussing the
trenching-work required in <i>pastinatio</i>, and devices for preventing the
disputes arising from bad execution of the same, he refers to <i>conductor</i>
as well as <i>dominus</i>. The interests of the two are liable to clash, and
he tries to shew a means of ensuring a fair settlement between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
parties without going to law. I understand the <i>conductor</i> to be a man
who has contracted for the job at an agreed price, and <i>exactor operis</i>
just below to be the landlord, whose business it is to get full value for
his money. Thus <i>conductor</i> here will be the same as the <i>redemptor</i> so
often employed in the scheme of Cato. I cannot find further traces of
him in Columella. Nor is the sale of a hanging<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> crop or a season’s
lambs to a speculator referred to. But we have other authority for
believing that contracts of this kind were not obsolete, and it is probable
that the same is true of contracts for special operations. That
such arrangements were nevertheless much rarer than in Cato’s time
seems to be a fair inference. The manifest reluctance<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> to hire external
labour also points to the desire of getting, so far as possible, all farming
operations performed by the actual farm-staff. If I have rightly judged
the position of tenant farmers, it is evident that their stipulated services
would be an important help in enabling the landlord to dispense with
employment of contractors’ gangs on the farm. This was in itself
desirable: that the presence of outsiders was unsettling to your own
slaves had long been remarked, and in the more elaborate organization
of Columella’s day disturbing influences would be more apprehensively
regarded than ever.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to follow out all the details of this complicated
system and enumerate the various special functions assigned to
the members of the staff. To get good foremen even at high prices
was one of the leading principles: an instance<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> is seen in the case of
vineyards, where we hear of a thoroughly competent <i>vinitor</i>, whose
price is reckoned at about £80 of our money, the estimated value of
about 4½ acres of land. The main point is that it is a system of slave
labour on a large scale, and that Columella, well aware that such labour
is in general wasteful, endeavours to make it remunerative by strict
order and discipline. He knows very well that current lamentations
over the supposed exhaustion<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> of the earth’s fertility are mere evasions
of the true causes of rural decay, neglect and ignorance. He knows
that intensive cultivation<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> pays well, and cites striking instances. But
the public for whom he writes is evidently not the men on small holdings,
largely market-gardeners<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a>, who were able to make a living with
or without slave-help, at all events when within reach of urban markets.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
He addresses men of wealth, most of whom were proud of their position
as landlords, but presumably not unwilling to make their estates
more remunerative, provided the effort did not give them too much
trouble. This condition was the real difficulty; and it is hard to believe
that Columella, when insisting on the frequent presence of the master’s
eye, was sanguine enough to expect a general response. His attitude
towards pastoral industry seems decidedly less enthusiastic than that
of his predecessors. Stock<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> must be kept on the farm, partly to eat off
your own fodder-crops, but chiefly for the sake of supplying manure
for the arable land. In quoting Cato’s famous saying on the profitableness
of grazing, he agrees that nothing pays so quickly as good
grazing, and that moderately good grazing pays well enough. But if,
as some versions have it, he really said that even bad grazing was the
next best thing for a farmer, Columella respectfully dissents. The
breeding and fattening of all manner of animals for luxurious tables<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>
remains much the same as in the treatise of Varro. A curious caution
is given<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> in discussing the fattening of thrushes. They are to be fed
with ‘dried figs beaten up with fine meal, as much as they can eat or
more. Some people chew the figs before giving them to the birds.
But it is hardly worth while to do this if you have a large number to
feed, for it costs money to hire<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> persons to do the chewing, and the
sweet taste makes them swallow a good deal themselves.’ Now, why
hire labour for such a purpose? Is it because slaves would swallow so
much of the sweet stuff that your thrushes would never fatten?</p>

<p>It is well known that importation of corn from abroad led to great
changes in Italian agriculture in the second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. The first was
the formation of great estates worked by slave-gangs, which seems to
have begun as an attempt to compete with foreign large-scale farming
in the general production of food-stuffs. If so, it was gradually discovered
that it did not pay to grow cereal crops for the market,
unscrupulous in slave-driving though the master might be. Therefore
attention was turned to the development on a larger scale of the existing
culture of the vine and olive and the keeping of great flocks and
herds. Food for these last had to be found on the farm in the winter,
and more and more it became usual only to grow cereals as fodder for
the stock, of course including the slaves. No doubt there was a demand
for the better sorts, such as wheat, in all the country towns, but the
farms in their immediate neighbourhood would supply the need. That
Columella assumes produce of this kind to be normally consumed on
the place, is indicated by his recommending<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> barley as good food for
all live-stock, and for slaves when mixed with wheat. Also by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
treating the delicate<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> white wheat, much fancied in Rome, as a degenerate
variety, not worth the growing by a practical farmer. His
instructions for storage shew the same point of view. The structure
and principles of granaries<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> are discussed at length, and the possibility
of long storage<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> is contemplated. The difficulties of transport by land
had certainly been an important influence in the changes of Roman
husbandry, telling against movements of bulky produce. Hence the
value attached<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> to situations near the seaboard or a navigable stream
(the latter not a condition often to be realized in Italy) by Columella
and his predecessors. Military roads served the traveller as well as the
armies, but took no regard<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> of agricultural needs. Moreover they had
special<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> drawbacks. Wayfarers had a knack of pilfering from farms
on the route, and someone or other was always turning up to seek
lodging and entertainment. Thus it was wise not to plant your villa
close to one of these trunk roads, or your pocket was likely to suffer.
But to have a decent approach<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> by a country road was a great convenience,
facilitating the landlord’s periodical visits and the carriage
of goods to and from the estate.</p>

<p>Certain words call for brief notice. Thus <i>opera</i>, the average day’s
work of an average worker, is Columella’s regular labour-unit in terms
of which he expresses the labour-cost<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> of an undertaking. In no other
writer is this more marked. Occasionally <i>operae</i> occurs in the well-known
concrete sense<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> of the ‘hands’ themselves. The <i>magistri</i> mentioned
are not always the foremen spoken of above, but sometimes<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>
directors or teachers in a general sense or even as a sort of synonym
for <i>professores</i>. To recur once again to <i>colonus</i>, the word, as in other
writers, often means simply ‘cultivator,’ not ‘tenant-farmer.’ The latter
special sense occurs in a passage<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> which would be useful evidence for
the history of farm-tenancies, if it were not doubtful whether the text
is sound.</p>

<p>There remains a question, much more than a merely literary
problem, as to the true relation of Columella to Vergil. That he constantly
quotes the poet, and cites him as an authority on agriculture,
is a striking fact. One instance will shew the deep veneration with
which he regards the great master. In speaking<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> of the attention to
local qualities of climate and soil needed in choosing an estate, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
quotes lines from the first <i>Georgic</i>, the matter of which is quite traditional,
common property. But he speaks of Vergil (to name the
poet<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> was unnecessary) as a most realistic<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>
    bard, to be trusted as an
oracle. Nay, so irresistible is to him the influence of Vergil, that he
must needs cast his own tenth book into hexameter verse: the subject
of that book is gardens, a topic on which Vergil had confessedly<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> not
fully said his say. And yet in the treatment of the land-question there
is a fundamental difference between the two writers. Columella’s
system is based on slave labour organized to ensure the completest
efficiency: Vergil practically ignores slavery altogether. Columella
advises you to let land to tenant farmers whenever you cannot effectively
superintend the working of slave-organizations under stewards:
Vergil ignores this solution also, and seems vaguely to contemplate a
return to the system of small farms owned and worked by free yeomen
in an idealized past. Columella is concerned to see that capital invested
in land is so employed as to bring in a good economic return: Vergil
dreams of the revival of a failing race, and possible economic success
and rustic wellbeing are to him not so much ends as means. The
contrast is striking enough. In the chapter on <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIX">Vergil</a> I have already
pointed out that the poet had at once captured the adoration of the
Roman world. It was not only in quotations or allusions, or in the
incense of praise, that his supremacy was held in evidence so long as
Latin literature remained alive. His influence affected prose style also,
and subtle reminiscences of Vergilian flavour maybe traced in Tacitus.
But all this is very different from the practice of citing him as an authority
on a special subject, as Columella did and the elder Pliny did
after him.</p>

<p>I would venture to connect this practice with the Roman habit of
viewing their own literature as inspired by Greek models and so tending
to move on parallel lines. Cicero was not content to be a Roman
Demosthenes; he must needs try to be a Roman Plato too, if not also
a Roman Aristotle. Now citation of the Homeric poems as a recognized
authority on all manner of subjects, not to mention casual illustrations,
runs through Greek literature. Plato and Aristotle are good
instances. It is surely not surprising that we find Roman writers
patriotically willing to cite their own great poet, more especially as
the <i>Georgics</i> lay ready to hand. In the next generation after Columella,
Quintilian framed his criticism<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> of the two literatures (as food for
oratorical students) on frankly parallel lines. Vergil is the pair to
Homer: second to the prince of singers, but a good second: and he is
quoted and cited throughout the treatise as Homer is in Aristotle’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
<i>Rhetoric</i>. True, the cases are not really parallel. Whatever preexistent
material may have served to build up the Homeric poems, they are at
least not didactic poems, made up of precepts largely derived from
technical writers, and refined into poetic form with mature and laborious
skill. To quote the <i>Georgics</i>, not only for personal observation
of facts but for guiding precepts, is often to quote a secondary authority
in a noble dress, and serves but for adornment. But in such a consideration
there would be nothing to discourage Roman literary men. To
challenge Vergil’s authority on a rustic subject remained the prerogative
of Seneca.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">XXXIV. GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>It is not easy to find a satisfactory line of division between the
period of the Flavian emperors and that of the adoptive series that
came after them. The Plebeian Flavians had no family claim, through
birth or adoption, to a preeminent position in the Roman world, and
the rise of Vespasian to power was indeed a revolution. Henceforth,
though outward forms and machinery remained, the real control of the
empire rested with those supported directly or indirectly by the great
armies. But the sound administrative policy set going by the common
sense of Vespasian long maintained the imperial fabric in strength, and
it is commonly held that from 69 to 180 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> was the Empire’s golden
age. Nevertheless its vitality was already ebbing, and the calamities
that beset it in the days of Marcus Aurelius found it unable to renew
its vigour after holding in check its barbarian invaders. The Flavian-Antonine
period must be treated as one, and from the point of view
of the present inquiry certain significant facts must always be borne in
mind. The Italian element in the armies was becoming less and less.
Military policy consisted chiefly in defence of the frontiers, for the
annexations of Trajan were not lasting, and they exhausted strength
needed for defence. It was an ominous sign that the Roman power
of assimilation was failing. Mixed armies of imperfectly Romanized
soldiery, whether as conquerors or as settlers, could not spread Roman
civilization in the same thorough way as it had become at length established
in Spain or southern Gaul. To spread it extensively and not
intensively meant a weakening of Roman grasp; and at some points<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>
it seems as if the influx of barbarism was felt to be a menace in time
of peace, not effectively counteracted by the peaceful penetration of
Rome.</p>

<p>Now, if the protection of Italy by chiefly alien swords was to relieve
the imperial centre from the heavy blood-tax borne by it in the old
days of Roman expansion, surely it remained an Italian function or
duty to provide carriers<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> of Roman civilization, that is, if border lands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
were to be solidly Romanized as a moral bulwark against barbarism.
But this duty could only be performed by a healthy and vigorous Italy,
and Italy<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> was not healthy and vigorous. Internal security left the
people free to go on in the same ways as they had now been following
for generations, and those ways, as we have seen, did not tend to the
revival of a free rural population. Country towns were not as yet in
manifest decay, but there were now no imperial politics, and municipal
politics, ever petty and self-regarding, offered no stimulus to arouse a
larger and common interest. Municipalities looked for benefactors, and
were still able to find them. In this period we meet with institutions
of a charitable kind, some even promoted by the imperial government,
for the benefit of orphans and children of the poor. This was a credit
to the humanity of the age, but surely a palliative of social ailments,
not a proof of sound condition. In Rome there was life, but it was
cosmopolitan life. Rome was the capital of the Roman world, not of
Italy. In the eyes of jealous patriots it seemed that what Rome herself
needed was a thorough Romanizing. It was not from the great wicked
city, thronged with adventurers<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> of every sort, largely Oriental Greeks,
and hordes of freedmen, that the better Roman influences could spread
abroad. Nor were the old Provinces, such as Spain and southern Gaul,
where Roman civilization had long been supreme, in a position to
assimilate<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> and Romanize the ruder border-lands by the Rhine and
Danube. They had no energies to spare: moreover, they too depended
on the central government, and the seat of that government
was Rome.</p>

<p>Italy alone could have vitalized the empire by moral influence, creating
in the vast fabric a spiritual unity, and making a great machine
into something more or less like a nation,—that is, if she had been
qualified for acting such a part. But Italy had never been a nation
herself. The result of the great Italian war of 90 and 89 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> had been
to merge Italy in Rome, not Rome in Italy. Italians, now Romans,
henceforth shared the exploitation of the subject countries and the
hatred of oppressed peoples. But under the constitution of the Republic
politics became more of a farce the more the franchise was extended, and
the most obvious effect of Italian enfranchisement was to increase the
number of those who directly or indirectly made a living out of provincial
wrongs. The Provinces swarmed with bloodsuckers of every kind. The
establishment of the Empire at length did something to relieve the
sufferings of the Provinces. But it was found necessary to recognize
Italy as a privileged imperial land. In modern times such privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
would take the form of political rights and responsibilities. But political
life was dead, and privilege could only mean local liberties, exemption
from burdens, and the like. And in the long run the maintenance or
abolition of privilege would have to depend on the success or failure of
the system. Now the emperors of the first two centuries of the Empire
did their best to maintain the privileged position of Italy. But even in
the time of Augustus it was already becoming clear that Romanized
Italy depended on Rome and that Rome, so far as the Senate and
Magistrates were concerned, could not provide for the efficient administration
of Italy or even of Rome itself. Then began the long gradual
process by which Italy, like the rest of the empire, passed more and
more under the control of the imperial machine. In the period we are
now considering this was steadily going on, for brief reactions, such as
that under Nerva, did not really check it, and Italy was well on the
way to become no more than a Province.</p>

<p>The feature of this period most important in connexion with the
present inquiry is the evidence<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> that emperors were as a rule painfully
conscious of Italian decay. Alive to the dangers involved in its continuance,
they accepted the responsibility of doing what they could to
arrest it. Their efforts took various forms, chiefly (<i>a</i>) the direct encouragement
of farming (<i>b</i>) relief of poverty (<i>c</i>) measures for providing
more rural population or preventing emigration of that still existing. It
is evident that the aim was to place and keep more free rustics on the
land. In the numerous allotments of land to discharged soldiers a
number of odd pieces<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> (<i>subsiciva</i>), not included in the lots assigned,
were left over, and had been occupied by squatters. Vespasian, rigidly
economical in the face of threatened state-bankruptcy, had the titles
inquired into, and resumed and sold those pieces where no valid grant
could be shewn. Either this was not fully carried out, or some squatters
must have been allowed to hold on as ‘possessors,’ probably paying a
quit-rent to the treasury. For Domitian<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> found some such people still
in occupation and converted their tenure into proprietorship, on the
ground that long possession had established a prescriptive right. Nerva
tried to go further<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> by buying land and planting agricultural colonies:
but little or nothing was really effected in his brief reign. In relief of
poverty it was a notable extension to look beyond the city of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
where corn-doles had long existed, and continued to exist. The plan
adopted was for the state to advance money at low rates of interest to
landowners in municipal areas, and to let the interest received form a
permanent endowment for the benefit of poor parents and orphans.
We must remember that to have children born did not imply a legal
obligation to rear them, and that the prospect of help from such funds
was a distinct encouragement to do so. Whether any great results were
achieved by this form of charity must remain doubtful: flattering assurances<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a>
to Trajan on the point can no more be accepted without reserve
than those addressed to Augustus on the success of his reforms,
or to Domitian on his promotion of morality. But it seems certain that
private charity was stimulated by imperial action, and that the total
sums applied in this manner were very large. Begun by Nerva, carried
out<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> by Trajan, extended by Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, the control
of these endowments was more centralized by Marcus. In his time great
dearth in Italy had made distress more acute, and the hour was at hand
when the inner disorders of the empire would cause all such permanent
foundations to fail and disappear. They may well have relieved many
individual cases of indigence, but we can hardly suppose their general
effect on the Italian population to have been a healthy one. They must
have tended to deaden enterprise and relax self-help, for they were too
much after the pauperizing model long established in Rome. The provision
of cheap loan-capital for landowners may or may not have been
a boon in the long run.</p>

<p>The increase of rustic population through excess of births over
deaths could not be realized in a day, even if the measures taken to
promote it were successful. So we find Trajan<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> not only founding
colonies in Italy but forbidding colonists to be drawn from Italy for
settlement in the Provinces; a restriction said to have been<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> disregarded
by Marcus. But one important sequel of the frontier wars of Marcus,
in which German mercenaries were employed, was the transplanting<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>
of large numbers of German captives into Italy. Such removals had
occurred before, but seldom and on a small scale. This wholesale
transplantation under Marcus made a precedent for many similar
movements later on. It may be taken for granted that the emperor did
not turn out Italians in order to find room for the new settlers. It is
also probable that these were bound to military service. The great
military colonies of later date, formed of whole tribes or nations settled
near the frontiers, certainly held their lands on military tenure. Such
was the system of frontier defence gradually forced upon Rome through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
the failure of native imperial forces sufficient for the purpose: and this
failure was first conspicuous in Italy. Among the various measures
taken by emperors to interest more persons in promoting Italian agriculture
we may notice Trajan’s<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> ordinance, that Provincials who aspired
to become Roman Senators must shew themselves true children of
Rome by investing one third of their property in Italian land. The
order seems to have been operative, but the reduction<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> of the fixed
minimum proportion from ⅓ to ¼ by Marcus looks as if the first rule
had been found too onerous. There is no reason to think that the state
of rural Italy was materially bettered by these well-meant efforts. And
the introduction of barbarian settlers, who had to be kept bound to the
soil in order to be readily available when needed for military service,
tended to give the rustic population a more and more stationary
character. It was in fact becoming more usual to let farms to free <i>coloni</i>;
but the <i>coloni</i>, though personally free, were losing freedom of movement.</p>

<h4 id="note2">NOTE ON EMIGRATION FROM ITALY.</h4>

<p>In the <i>Journal of Roman Studies</i> (vol <span class="allsmcap">VIII</span>) I have discussed the question
whether the emigration from Italy to the Provinces was to a serious extent
agricultural in character, and in particular whether we can believe it to have
carried abroad real working rustics in large numbers. Are we to see in it an
important effective cause of the falling-off of the free rustic population of Italy?
That the volume of emigration was large may be freely granted; also that
settlements of discharged soldiers took place from time to time. Nor does it
seem doubtful that many of the emigrants became possessors of farm-lands<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>
in the Provinces. But that such persons were working rustics, depending on
their own labour, is by no means clear. And, if they were not, the fact of their
holding land abroad does not bear directly on the decay of the working farmer
class in Italy. That commerce and finance and exploitation in general were
the main occupations of Italian<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> emigrants, I do not think can be seriously
doubted. And that many of them combined landholding with their other
enterprises is probable enough.</p>

<p>Professor Reid kindly reminds me that soldiers from Italy, whose term of
service expired while they were still in a Province, were apt to settle down
there in considerable numbers. The case of Carteia in Spain is well known,
and that of Avido, also in Spain, was probably of the same nature. These
were not regular Colonies. So too in Africa Marius seems to have left behind
him communities of soldiers not regularly organized<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> as <i>coloniae</i>.
    When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
town of Uchi Maius received the title of <i>colonia</i> from the emperor Severus,
it called itself<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> <i>colonia Mariana</i>, like the one founded by Marius in Corsica.
And the same title appears in the case<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> of Thibari. With these African settlements
we may connect the law carried by Saturninus in 100 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span> to provide the
veterans of Marius with allotments of land in Africa, on the scale of 100 <i>iugera</i>
for each man. If this record<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> is to be trusted (and the doubtful points cannot
be discussed here), the natural inference is that farms of considerable size are
meant, for the working of which no small amount of labour would be required.
Nor is this surprising, for the soldiers of Marius were at the time masters of
the situation, and not likely to be content with small grants. Whether the
allotments proposed were in Africa or in Cisalpine Gaul<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> is not quite certain.
Marius seems to have left Africa in the winter of 105-4 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>. Since then he
had been engaged in the war with the northern barbarians, and the lands recovered
from the invaders were in question. Still, the proposal may have
referred to Africa, for it is certain that the connexion of Marius with that
Province was remembered<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> long after. The important point is that the persons
to be gratified were not civilian peasants but discharged veterans of the New
Model army, professionalized by Marius himself. Neither the retired professional
mercenaries of Greco-Macedonian armies, nor the military colonists of
Sulla, give us reason to believe that such men would regard hard and monotonous
labour with their own hands as a suitable reward for the toils and perils
of their years of military service. Surely they looked forward to a life of comparative
ease, with slaves to labour under their orders. If they kept their hold
on their farms, they would become persons of some importance in their own
provincial neighbourhood. Such were the <i>milites</i> or <i>veterani</i> whom we find
often mentioned under the later Empire: and these too were evidently not
labourers but landlords and directors.</p>

<p>Therefore I hold that the class of men, many of them Italians by descent,
whom we find holding land in various Provinces and living on the profits of
the same, were mostly if not all either soldier-settlers or persons to whom landholding
was one of several enterprises of exploitation. That the mere Italian
peasant emigrated in such numbers as seriously to promote the falling-off of
the free rustic population of Italy, is a thesis that I cannot consider as proved
or probable.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXV">XXXV. MUSONIUS.</h3>

<p>In earlier chapters I have found it necessary to examine the views
of philosophers on the subject of agriculture and agricultural labour,
holding it important to note the attitude of great thinkers towards
these matters. And indeed a good deal is to be gleaned from Plato
and Aristotle. Free speculations on the nature of the State included
not only strictly political inquiries, but social and economic also. But
in the Macedonian period, when Greek states no longer enjoyed unrestricted
freedom of movement and policy, a change came over
philosophy. The tendency of the schools that now shewed most vital
energy, such as the Epicurean and Stoic, was to concern themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
with the Individual rather than the State. The nature of Man, and his
possibilities of happiness, became more and more engrossing topics.
As the political conditions under which men had to live were now
manifestly imposed by circumstances over which the ordinary citizen
had no control, the happiness of the Individual could no longer be
dependent on success in political ambitions and the free play of civic
life. It had to be sought in himself, independent of circumstances.
The result was that bold questioning and the search for truth ceased
to be the prime function of philosophic schools, and the formation of
character took the first place. Hence the elaboration of systems meant
to regulate a man’s life by implanting in him a fixed conception of the
world in which he had to live, and his relation to the great universe of
which he and his immediate surroundings formed a part. And this
implied a movement which may be roughly described as from questioning
to dogma. The teacher became more of a preacher, his disciples
more of a congregation of the faithful; and more and more the efficiency
of his ministrations came to depend on his own personal influence,
which we often call magnetism.</p>

<p>When Greek literature and thought became firmly established in
Rome during the second century <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, it was just this dogmatic treatment
of moral questions that gave philosophy a hold on a people far
more interested in conduct than in speculation. The Roman attempts,
often clumsy enough, to translate principle into practice were, and
continued to be, various in spirit and success. Stoicism in particular
blended most readily with the harder and more virile types of Roman
character, and found a peculiarly sympathetic reception among eminent
lawyers. The reigns of the first emperors were not favourable to moral
philosophy; but the accession of Nero set literature, and with it
moralizing, in motion once more. A kind of eclectic Stoicism came
into fashion, a Roman product, of which Seneca was the chief representative.
A touch of timeserving was needed to adapt Greek theories
for practical use in the world of imperial Rome. Seneca was both a
courtier and a wealthy landowner, and was one of the victims of Nero’s
tyranny. We have seen that while preaching Stoic doctrine, for instance
on the relations of master and slave, he shews little interest in
agriculture for its own sake or in the conditions of agricultural labour.
It is interesting to contrast with his attitude that of another Stoic, a
man of more uncompromising and consistent type, whose life was
partly contemporaneous with that of Seneca, and who wrote only a
few years later under the Flavian emperors.</p>

<p><b>Musonius<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> Rufus</b>, already a teacher of repute in Nero’s time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
seems to have kept himself clear of conspiracies and intrigues, recognizing
the necessity of the monarchy and devoting himself to his profession
of moral guide to young men. But any great reputation was
dangerous in Nero’s later years, and a pretext was found for banishing
the philosopher in 65. Under Galba he returned to Rome, still convinced
of the efficacy of moral suasion, witnessed the bloody successions
of emperors in 69, and risked his life in an ill-timed effort to
stay the advance of Vespasian’s soldiery by discoursing on the blessings
of peace. Vespasian seems to have allowed him to remain in
Rome, and he is said to have been tutor to Titus. Yet he had not
shrunk from bringing to justice an informer guilty of the judicial
murder of a brother Stoic, and he was generally regarded as the
noblest of Roman teachers, both in principles and in practice. He has
been spoken of as a forerunner of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.
Evidently no timeserver, he seems to have made allowance for human
needs and human weakness in the application of strict moral rules. It
is a great pity that we have no complete authentic works of his surviving:
but some of the reports by a pupil or pupils have come down
to us. One of these extracts<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> is so complete in itself, and so striking
in its view of agriculture and agricultural labour, that I have translated
it here. We are to bear in mind that the opinions expressed in it
belong to a time when a small number of great landlords owned a
large part (and that the most attractive) of Italy, and vast estates in
the provinces as well. It is the luxurious and slave-ridden world of
Petronius and Seneca that we must keep before us in considering the
advice of Musonius; advice which we cannot simply ignore, however
much we may see in this good man a voice crying in the wilderness.</p>

<p>‘There is also another resource<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a>, nowise inferior to the above, one
that might reasonably be deemed superior to it, at least for a man of
strong body: I mean that derived from the land, whether the farmer
owns it or not. For we see that there are many who, though cultivating
land owned by the state<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> or by other persons, are yet able to
support not only themselves but wives and children; while there are
some who by the devoted industry of their own hands<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> attain to great
abundance in this way of life. For the earth responds most fairly and
justly to the care bestowed upon her, returning manifold what she
receives and providing a plenty of all things necessary to life for him
that will labour; and she does it consistently with a man’s self-respect
and dignity. For nobody, other than an effeminate weakling, would
describe any of the operations of husbandry as disgraceful or incompatible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
with manly excellence. Are not planting ploughing vine-dressing
honourable works? And sowing reaping threshing, are not these all
liberal pursuits, suited to good men? Nay, the shepherd’s life, if it did
not degrade Hesiod or hinder him from winning divine favour and
poetic renown, neither will it hinder others. For my part, I hold this
to be the best of all the tasks comprised in husbandry, inasmuch as it
affords the soul more leisure for pondering and investigating what concerns
mental culture. For all tasks that bend the body and keep it
fully on the strain do at the same time force the soul to give them its
whole attention, or nearly so, sharing as it does the strain of the body:
but all those that permit the body to escape excessive strain do not
prevent the soul from reasoning out important questions and from improving
its own wisdom by such reasonings, a result which is the special
aim of every philosopher. This is why I set such special value on the
art of shepherds. If however a man does<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> combine tillage with philosophy,
I hold no other life comparable with this, and no other means
of livelihood preferable to it. Surely it is more according to nature to
get your sustenance from Earth, our nurse and mother, than from some
other source. Surely it is more manly<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> to live on a farm than to sit
idle in a city. Surely out-of-door pursuits are healthier than sheltered
retirement. Which, pray, is the freeman’s choice, to meet his needs by
receiving from others, or by contrivance of his own? Why, it is thought
far more dignified to be able to satisfy your own requirements unaided
than with aid of others. So true is it that to live by husbandry, of
course with due respect<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> to what is good and honourable, is beautiful
and conducive to happiness and divine favour. Hence it was that the
god (Delphic Apollo) proclaimed<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> that Myson of Chenae was a wise
man and greeted Aglaus of Psophis as a happy one; for these both led
rustic lives, working with their own hands and not spending their time
in cities. Surely then it is a worthy ambition to follow these men’s
example and devote ourselves to husbandry in earnest.</p>

<p>‘Some may think it a monstrous notion that a man of educative
power, qualified to lead youths on to philosophy, should till the soil
and do bodily labour like a rustic. And, if it had been the fact that
tilling the soil hinders the pursuit of philosophy or the lending help to
others in that pursuit, the notion would have been monstrous indeed.
But, as things are, if young men could see their teacher at work in the
country, demonstrating in practice the principle to which reason guides
us, namely that bodily toil and suffering are preferable to dependence
on others for our food, I think it would be more helpful to them than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
attendance at his lectures in town. What is to hinder the pupil, while
he works at his teacher’s side, from catching his utterances on self-control
or justice or fortitude? For the right pursuit of philosophy is
not promoted by much talking, and young men are under no necessity
to learn off the mass of speculation on these topics, an accomplishment
of which the Professors<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> are so vain. For such discourses are indeed
sufficient to use up a man’s lifetime: but it is possible to pick up the
most indispensable and useful points even when one is engaged in the
work of husbandry, especially as the work will not be unceasing but
admits periods of rest. Now I am well aware that few will be willing
to receive instruction by this method: but it is better that the majority
of youths who profess the pursuit of philosophy should never attend a
philosopher at all, I mean those unsound effeminate creatures whose
presence at the classes is a stain upon the name of philosophy. For of
those that have a genuine love of philosophy not one would be unwilling
to spend his time with a good man on a farm, aye though that farm
were one most difficult<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> to work; seeing that he would reap great advantages
from this employment. He would have the company of his
teacher night and day; he would be removed from the evils of city life,
which are a stumbling-block to the pursuit of philosophy; his conduct,
good or bad, could not escape notice (and nothing benefits a pupil
more than this); moreover, to be under the eye of a good man when
eating and drinking and sleeping is a great benefit.’</p>

<p>At this point the writer digresses for a moment to quote some
lines of Theognis and to interpret them in a sense favourable to his own
views. He then continues ‘And let no one say that husbandry is a
hindrance to learning or teaching. Surely it is not so, if we reflect that
under these conditions the pupil enjoys most fully the company of his
teacher while the teacher has the fullest control of his pupil. Such
then being the state of the case, it is clear that of the philosopher’s
resources none is more useful or more becoming than that drawn from
husbandry.’</p>

<p>In this extract three points simply stand for principles dear to all
sincere Stoics; (1) the duty and benefit of living ‘according to Nature,’
(2) the duty and benefit of self-sufficiency and not depending on the
support of others, (3) the duty and satisfaction of continued self-improvement.
Consistent practice on these lines would go far to produce
the Stoic ideal, the Wise Man, happy and perfect in his assurance and
dignity. But the attempt to combine all these in a ‘back to the land’
scheme of moral betterment has surely in it a marked personal note.
It is the dream of a singular man in the surroundings of a rotten civilization;
a civilization more rotten, and a dream more utopian, than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
the dreamer could possibly know. Aspirations towards a healthy outdoor
life had been felt by many before Musonius. Admiration of rustic
pursuits was no new thing, but it was generally freedom from worries,
with the occasional diversions of the chase, that were attractive to the
town-bred man. Ploughing and digging, and the responsible charge of
flocks and herds, had long been almost entirely left to slaves, and
Musonius is driven to confess that few youths of the class from which
he drew pupils would be willing to undertake such occupations. It was
useless to urge that bodily labour is not degrading: that it is exhausting,
and engrosses the whole attention, he could not deny. He falls
back on pastoral duties as light and allowing leisure for serious discourse.
The suggestion seems unreal, though sincere, when we remember
that Italian shepherds had to fight wolves and brigands.
Moreover, the preference of grazing to tillage was in no small degree
due to the fewer persons employed in it, and the stockmen were a
notoriously rough class. Even the idealized shepherds of the bucolic
poets exhibit a coarseness not congenial to conversation savouring of
virtue. But to a Stoic preacher who could try to pacify a licentious
soldiery the notion of using pastoral pursuits as a means to moral
excellence may well have seemed a reasonable proposal.</p>

<p>It is at least clear that the futility of philosophy as administered
by lecturers in Rome had made a strong impression on Musonius. The
fashionable company to whom the discourses were addressed, whether
they for the moment shed some of their self-satisfaction or not, were
seldom or never induced to remodel their worthless lives. So Musonius
urges them to break away from solemn trifling and take to rustic
labour. He probably chose this remedy as one specially Roman, following
the tradition of the heroes of ancient Rome. But no artificial
revival of this kind was possible, whatever his generous optimism
might say. His contemporary the elder Pliny, who was content to
glorify the vanished past and deplore the present, had a truer appreciation
of the facts. Farm-work as a means of bringing personal influence
to bear, treating body and mind together, a sort of ‘Wisdom
while you dig,’ was in such a society a merely fantastic proposal. The
importance of farming and food-production was a commonplace, but
the vocation of Musonius was moralizing and character-production.
There is no reason to think that he had any practical knowledge of
agriculture. His austere life proves nothing of the kind. The only
remark that shews acquaintance with conditions of landholding is his
reference to the farmers who make a living on hired land. And this is
in too general terms to have any historical value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">XXXVI. PLINY THE ELDER.</h3>

<p>Among the writers of this period who refer to agricultural matters the
most important is the <b>elder Pliny</b>, who contrived in a life of public
service<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> in various departments to amass a prodigious quantity of miscellaneous
learning and to write many erudite works. His <i>naturalis
historia</i>, an extraordinary compilation of encyclopaedic scope, contains
numerous references to agriculture, particularly in the eighteenth book.
He collected and repeated the gleanings from his omnivorous reading,
and the result is more remarkable for variety and bulk than for choice
and digestion. As a recorder he is helpful, preserving as he does a
vast number of details, some not otherwise preserved, others of use in
checking or supplementing other versions. Far removed as the book
is from being a smooth and readable literary work, the moralizing
rhetoric of the age shews its influence not only in the constant effort
to wring a lesson of some kind out of the topic of the moment, but in
the longer sermonizing passages that lead up to some subject on which
the writer feels deeply. One of these<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> occurs in introducing agriculture,
and in pursuing the subject he loses no opportunity of contrasting a
degenerate present with a better past. We need not take his lamentations
at their full face-value, but that they were in the main justified
is not open to doubt. It has been so often necessary to cite him in
earlier chapters, that we shall not have to dwell upon him at great
length here.</p>

<p>The functions of compiler and antiquarian are apt to coincide very
closely, and it is in his picture of the earlier conditions of Roman and
Italian farming that Pliny’s evidence is most interesting. The old
traditions<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> of the simple and manly yeomen, each tilling his own little
plot of ground, content with his seven <i>iugera</i> of land or even with two
in the earliest times, Cincinnatus and the rest of the farmer-heroes, to
whom their native soil, proud of her noble sons, responded<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> with a
bounteous fertility that she denies to the heartless labour of slave-gangs
on modern <i>latifundia</i>,—these are the topics on which he enlarges with
a rhetorical or even poetic warmth. The ruin of Italy, nay of Provinces
too, through the land-grabbing and formation of vast estates, is denounced<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
in a classic passage. He sees no end to the process. Six
landlords held between them half the Province of Africa in the time of
Nero. Wanting money, the emperor put them to death for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
their property. He does not add, but doubtless reflected, that such
measures only added to the resources controlled by a tyrant ruler, not
a desirable object. We may add further that such iniquities inevitably
disposed virtuous emperors to leave the land-monopolizers a free hand,
perhaps unwillingly; but these gentry were not breaking the law by
buying land, and an emperor conscious of the burden of administration,
and desiring to carry on his work undisturbed by internal disloyalty,
had strong reasons for not provoking wealthy capitalists. To conciliate
them, and if possible to engage their cooperation in schemes designed
for the public good according to the ideas of the time, was to proceed
on the line of least resistance.</p>

<p>Among the traditional precepts handed on by Pliny from Cato and
others are many with which we are already familiar. Such is the rule
of Regulus<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>, that in buying a farm regard must be had to the healthiness
of the situation as well as to the richness of the soil. Another is
the need of keeping a due proportion<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> between farm-house and farm.
Great men of the late Republic, Lucullus and Scaevola, erred on this
point in opposite directions: Marius on the other hand laid out a <i>villa</i>
so skilfully that Sulla said ‘here was a man at last with eyes in his
head.’ The value of the master’s eye is another old friend. We have
also seen above that Mago’s<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> advice, when you buy a farm, to sell your
town house, was not a policy to be followed by Romans of quality, who
felt it a duty not to cut themselves off from touch with public affairs.
Another tradition is that of the sentiment of the olden time, holding
it criminal<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> to slay man’s fellow-worker, the ox. In referring to the
technical skill required in a steward, a favourite topic of Cato, Pliny
gives his own view<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> briefly, ‘the master ought to set the greatest store
by his steward, but the fellow should not be aware of it.’ The calculation
of labour-cost<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> in terms of <i>operae</i>, as with others, so with him, is
a regular way of reckoning. And we meet once more the saying that,
while good cultivation is necessary, too high farming does not pay.
He illustrates this by an instance<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> of comparatively modern date. A
man of very humble origin, who rose through military merit to the
consulship, was rewarded by Augustus with a large sum of money:
this he spent on buying land<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> in Picenum and fancy-farming. In this
course he ran through his property, and his heir did not think it worth
his while to claim the succession. The general tendency of all these
precepts and anecdotes is to commend moderation and to rebuke the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
foolish ambition of land-proud capitalists of his own day. His praise
of the ancient ways and regret for their disappearance do not suggest
any hope of their revival. To Pliny as to others it was only too clear
that legends of conquering consuls setting their own hands to the
plough had no practical bearing on the conditions of the present age.</p>

<p>Thoughtful men<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> could not ignore the fact that the decline in production
of cereal crops left Italy exposed to risk of famine. At any
moment storms might wreck the corn-fleets from Egypt or Africa, and
the strategic value of Egypt<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> as a vital food-centre had been shewn
quite recently in strengthening the cause of Vespasian. No wonder
Pliny is uneasy, and looks back regretfully<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> to the time when Italy
was not fed by the Provinces, when thrifty citizens grew their own
staple food-stuffs, and corn was plentiful and cheap. He quotes some
prices from the time of the great Punic wars and earlier, which shew
the remarkable cheapness of wine oil dried figs and flesh, as well as of
various grains. This result was not due to great estates owned by
individual landlords<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> who elbowed out their neighbours, but to the
willing work of noble citizens tilling their little holdings. To look for
similar returns from the task-work of chained and branded slaves is a
sheer libel on Mother Earth. That he treats at great length of agricultural
details, not only of grain-crops in their various kinds, but fruits,
vegetables, indeed everything he can think of, and all the processes of
cultivation, is due to his encyclopaedic bent, and need not detain us
here. When he tells us<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> that vine-growing was a comparatively late
development among the Romans, who long were content with grain-growing,
it is a passing sigh over a vanished age of simple life. The
meaning of words changes and records the change of things. When
the Twelve Tables<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> spoke of <i>hortus</i>, it was not a garden in the modern
sense, a place of pleasure and luxury, that was meant, but a poor man’s
small holding. By that venerable code it was made a criminal offence<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>
to cut or graze off under cover of night the crops raised on a man’s
plough-land. A man whose farm was badly cultivated was disgraced
by the censors. For, as Cato<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> said, there is no life like the farmer’s for
breeding sturdy men to make efficient soldiers and loyal citizens. The
gist of these utterances, picked out of the mass, is that Pliny would
like to see Italy able to provide for her own feeding and her own defence,
but knows very well that no such ideal is within the range of
hope.</p>

<p>His interest in agriculture such as he saw it around him is shewn
in recording recent or contemporary doings, such as that of the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
mentioned above who squandered a fortune on ill-judged farming. A
more successful venture<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> was that of Remmius Palaemon, apparently
in the time of Claudius. He was a freedman, not a farmer, but a school-master
(<i>grammaticus</i>) of repute, a vainglorious fellow. He bought some
land, not of the best quality and let down by bad farming. To farm this
he engaged another freedman, one Acilius Sthenelus, who had the vineyards
thoroughly overhauled (<i>pastinatis de integro</i>). Before eight years
were out, he was able to sell a hanging crop for half as much again as
it had cost him to buy the land, and within ten years he sold the land
itself to Seneca (not a man for fancy prices) for four times as much as
he had given for it. Truly a fine speculation. Sthenelus had carried
out another of the same kind<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> on his own account. We must note that
both were in the vine-culture, not in corn-growing, and the appearance
of freedmen, probably oriental Greeks, as leaders of agricultural enterprise
in Italy. There is nothing to shew that these undertakings were
on a large scale: the land in Sthenelus’ own case is stated as not more
than 60 <i>iugera</i>. But no doubt he was, like many of his tribe, a keen
man of business<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> and not too proud or preoccupied to give close attention
to the matter in hand. Such a man would get the utmost out of
his slaves and check waste: he would keep a tight grip on a slave
steward if (which we are not told) he found it necessary to employ one
at all. For Pliny, as for most Romans, a profitable speculation had
great charms. He cannot resist repeating the old Greek story<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> of the
sage who demonstrated his practical wisdom by making a ‘corner’ in
olive-presses, foreseeing a ‘bumper’ crop. Only he turns it round,
making it a ‘corner’ in oil, in view of a poor crop and high prices, and
tells it not of Thales but of Democritus.</p>

<p>There were of course many principles of agriculture that no economic
or social changes could affect. The ‘oracle’ of Cato, as to the
importance<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> of thorough and repeated ploughing followed by liberal
manuring, was true under all conditions. But just for a moment the
veil is lifted to remind us that in the upland districts there was still an
Italy agriculturally, as socially, very different from the lowland arable
of which we generally think when speaking of Italian farming. ‘Ploughing
on hillsides<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> is cross-wise, and so toilsome to man that he even
has to do ox-team’s work: at least the mountain peoples<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> use the
mattock for tillage instead of the plough, and do without the ox.’ It
is to be regretted that we have so little evidence as to the condition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
the dalesmen, other than the passages of such writers as Horace and
Juvenal, who refer to them as rustic folk a sojourn among whom is a
refreshing experience after the noise and bustle of Rome. For it seems
certain that in these upland retreats there survived whatever was left
of genuine Italian life, and we should like to be able to form some
notion of its quantity; that is, whether the population of freemen on
small holdings, living mostly on the produce of their own land, was
numerically an important element in the total population of Italy.
That great stretches of hill-forest were in regular use simply as summer
pastures, and that the bulk of the arable lands were held in great
estates, and slaves employed in both departments, we hear in wearisome
iteration. But to get a true picture of the country as a whole is,
in the absence of statistics, not possible.</p>

<p>I have not been able to discover in Pliny any definite repugnance
to slavery as a system. It is true that he is alive to the evils of the
domestic slavery prevalent in his day. The brigades of slaves (<i>mancipiorum
legiones</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> filling the mansions of the rich, pilfering at every
turn, so that nothing is safe unless put under lock and seal, are a
nuisance and a demoralizing influence. They are an alien throng (<i>turba
externa</i>) in a Roman household; a sad contrast<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> to the olden time,
when each family had its one slave, attached to his master’s clan, when
the whole household lived in common, and nothing had to be locked
up. But this is only one of Pliny’s moralizing outbreaks, and it is the
abuse and overgrowth of slavery, not slavery in itself, that he is denouncing.
In speaking of agriculture he says ‘to have farms cultivated
by slave-gangs<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> is a most evil thing, as indeed are all acts performed by
those who have no hope.’ Here the comparative inefficiency of workers
who see no prospect of bettering their condition is plainly recognized;
but it is the economic defect, not the outrage on a common humanity,
that inspires the consciously futile protest. And at the very end of
his great book, when he breaks out into a farewell panegyric<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> on Italy,
and enumerates the various elements of her preeminence among the
countries of the world, he includes the supply of slave-labour<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> in the
list. Spain perhaps comes next, but here too the organized employment<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>
of slaves is one of the facts that are adduced to justify her praise.
Now I do not imagine that Pliny was a hard unkindly man. But he
evidently accepted slavery as an established institution, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
economic bases of society. He saw its inferiority to free labour, but a
passing protest seemed to him enough. Had he been asked, Why don’t
you recommend free labour directly? I think he would have answered,
Where are you going to find it in any quantity? And it is obvious that,
slave labour once assumed, the great thing was to have enough of it.
Nor again have I found him using <i>colonus</i> in the sense of tenant farmer.
In that of ‘cultivator’ it occurs several times, as in the quotation<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> from
Cato, that to call a man <i>bonum colonum</i> was of old the height of praise.
Figuratively it appears in comparisons, as when the guilt of the slayer
of an ox is emphasized<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> by the addition ‘as if he had made away with
his <i>colonus</i>.’ So of the fertilizing Nile he says ‘discharging the duty<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> of
a <i>colonus</i>.’ In the passage where he warns his readers against too high
farming<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> he remarks ‘There are some crops that it does not pay to gather,
unless the owner is employing his own children or a <i>colonus</i> of his own
or hands that have on other grounds to be fed—I mean, if you balance
the cost against the gain.’ Here it is just possible that he means ‘a
tenant of his own,’ that is a tenant long attached to the estate, like the
<i>coloni indigenae</i> of Columella: but I think it is quite neutral, and probably
he has in mind either a relative or a slave. The ‘persons for whose
keep he is responsible’ sums up to the effect that if you have mouths
to fill you may as well use their labour, for it will add nothing to your
labour-bill. So far as I have seen, the difference between ownership and
tenancy is not a point of interest to Pliny.</p>

<p>In continuation of what has been said above as to the relations of
Vergil and Columella, it is necessary to discuss briefly the attitude of
Pliny towards these two writers. The indices to the <i>Natural History</i>
at once disclose the fact that citations of Vergil<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> are about six times as
numerous as those of Columella. Indeed he seldom refers to the latter;
very often to Varro, even more often to Cato. The frequent references
to Vergil may reasonably be explained as arising from a wish to claim
whenever possible the moral support of the now recognized chief figure
of Roman literature. This was all the more easy, inasmuch as Vergil’s
precepts in the <i>Georgics</i><a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> are mostly old or borrowed doctrine cast into
a perfect form. Columella had used them in a like spirit, but in dealing
with the labour-question he faced facts, not only instructing his readers
in the technical processes of agriculture, but setting forth the forms of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
labour-organization by which those processes were to be carried on. Now
Pliny records an immense mass of technical detail, but of labour-organization
he says hardly any thing; for his laments over a vanished
past are only of use in relieving his own feelings. And yet the labour-question,
and the tenancy-question connected therewith, were the
central issues of the agricultural problem. It was not the knowledge
of technical details that was conspicuously lacking, but the will and
means to apply knowledge already copious. Not what to do, but how
to get it done, was the question which Columella tried to answer and
Pliny, like Vergil, did not really face. It is curious to turn out the
eight distinct references to Columella in Pliny. In none of these passages
is there a single word of approval, and the general tone of them
is indifferent and grudging. Sometimes the words seem to suggest that
his authority is not of much weight, or pointedly remark that it stands
quite alone. In one place<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> he is flatly accused of ignorance. When we
consider that Pliny speaks of Varro with high respect, and positively
worships Cato and Vergil, it is clear that there must have been some
special reason for this unfriendly and half-contemptuous attitude. The
work of Columella did not deserve such treatment. It evidently held its
ground in spite of sneers, for Palladius in the fourth century cites it
repeatedly as one of the leading authorities. It is not difficult to conjecture
possible causes for the attitude of Pliny: but none of those that
occur to me is sufficient, even if true, to justify it. I must leave it as
one of the weak points in the <i>Natural History</i>.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">XXXVII. TACITUS.</h3>

<p><b>P Cornelius Tacitus</b>, one of the great figures of Roman literature,
passed through the time of the Flavian emperors, but his activity as a
writer belonged chiefly to the reign of Trajan. Like most historians,
he gave his attention to public and imperial affairs, and we get from
him very little as to the conditions of labour. Of emperors and their
doings evil or good, of the upper classes and their reactionary sympathies,
their intrigues and perils, we hear enough: but of the poor wage-earners<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>
and slaves hardly anything, for to one who still regretted the
Republic while accepting the Empire, an aristocrat at heart, the lower
orders were of no more importance than they had been to Cicero.
Indeed they were now less worthy of notice, as free political life had
ceased and the city rabble, no longer needed for voting and rioting, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
merely to be fed and amused. A populace of some sort was a necessary
element in the imperial capital: that it was in fact a mongrel mob
could not be helped, and year by year it became through manumissions
of slaves a mass of more and more cosmopolitan pauperism. The
Provinces and the frontier armies were matters of deep interest, but
the wars of the succession after Nero only served to exhibit with irresistible
stress the comparative unimportance of Italy. Tacitus, a Roman
of good family, born in Italy if not in Rome, dignified and critical by
temperament, was not the man to follow the fashion of idle and showy
rhetoric. He does not waste time and effort in vainly deploring the loss
of a state of things that could not be restored. That the present condition
of Italy grieved him, we may feel sure. But he viewed all things
in a spirit of lofty resignation. That he was led to contrast the real or
assumed virtues of German barbarians with the flagrant vices of Roman
life was about the limit of his condescension to be a preacher: and it
is not necessary to assume that the pointing of a moral was the sole
motive of his tract on the land and tribes of Germany.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the uneasiness of Tiberius as to the food-supply<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>
of Rome, dependent on importations of corn which were liable
to be interrupted by foul weather and losses at sea. The risk was real
enough, and the great artificial harbours constructed at the Tiber mouth
by Claudius and Trajan were chiefly meant to provide accommodation
for corn-fleets close at hand, with large granaries to store cargoes<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> in
reserve. The slave rising of 24 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> in south-eastern Italy, and its suppression,
have also been mentioned<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> above. These passages, and a
passing reference to the unproductiveness<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> of the soil (of Italy) are
significant of the inefficiency of Italian agriculture in the time of Tiberius.
But in reporting these matters Tacitus writes as historian, not as a
contemporary witness, and enough has been said of them above. A
curious passage, not yet referred to, is that describing the campaign<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>
against money-lenders in 33 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. A law passed by Julius Caesar in
<span class="allsmcap">BC</span> 49 with the object of relieving the financial crisis without resorting
to a general cancelling of debts, long obsolete, was raked up again, and
there was widespread alarm, for most senators had money out on loan.
It seems that some trials and condemnations actually took place, and
that estates of the guilty were actually seized and sold for cash under
the provisions of a disused law. Further trouble at once followed, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
there was a general calling in of mortgages, while cash was scarce, the
proceeds of the late sales having passed into one or other of the state
treasuries. Eighteen months grace had been granted to enable offending
capitalists to arrange their affairs in conformity with the law. Evidently
these gentry were in no hurry to reinvest their money as it came in,
but waited for a fall in the price of land, certain to occur as a consequence
of dearer money. In order to guard against such a result, the
Senate had ordered that each (that is, each paid-off creditor,) should
invest ⅔ of his loanable capital in Italian real estate, and that each
debtor<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> should repay ⅔ of his debt at once. But the creditors were
demanding payment in full, and it did not look well for the debtors to
weaken their own credit (by practically confessing insolvency). So
there was great excitement, followed by uproar in the praetor’s court:
and the measures intended to relieve the crisis—the arrangements for
sale and purchase—had just the opposite effect. For the capitalists had
locked up all their money with a view to the (eventual) purchase of
land. The quantity of land thrown on the market sent prices down,
and the more encumbered a man was the more difficult he found it to
dispose of his land (that is, at a price that would clear him of debt).
Numbers of people were ruined, and the situation was only saved by
Tiberius, who advanced a great sum of money to be used in loans for
three years free of interest, secured in each case on real estate<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> of twice
the value. Thus confidence was restored and private credit gradually
revived. But, Tacitus adds, the purchase of land on the lines of the
Senate’s order was never carried through: in such matters it is the way
of the world to begin with zeal and end with indifference.</p>

<p>If I have rightly given the sense of this passage, it furnishes some
points of interest. It sets before us a state of things in which a number
of landowners have raised money by mortgaging their real estate, disregarding
the provisions (whatever they were) of a law practically
disused. This reminds us that one very general use of Italian land
was as a security on which money could at need be raised. It was the
only real security always available, and this inclined people to keep
their hold on it, though as a direct income-producer it seldom gave good
returns. No doubt they had to pay on their borrowings a higher rate<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>
of interest than they got on their capital invested in land. To be forced
suddenly to sell their lands in a glutted market was manifest ruin; for
the whole strength of their position lay in the justified assumption that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
the capital value of their land in the market exceeded the amount of
their mortgage debts. Otherwise, who would have lent them the money
on that security? We can hardly avoid the suspicion that the frequent
use of land as a pledge may have had something to do with that unsatisfactory
condition of agriculture on which the evidence of Latin
writers has driven us to dwell. The mortgagor, once he had got the
money advanced, had less interest in the landed security: the mortgagee,
so long as he got his good return on the money lent, was unconcerned
to see that his debtor’s income was maintained; and that, in taking a
mortgage, he had insisted on a large margin of security for his capital,
is not to be doubted. For what purpose these loans were generally
contracted, we are not told. Those who borrowed money to waste it
in extravagance would surely have found it more business-like to sell
their land outright. The number of those who preferred to keep it,
though encumbered on onerous terms, simply from social pride, cannot
have been really large; but they would hardly make wise landlords.
Probably some men raised money to employ it in speculations<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> that
seemed to offer rich returns. So long as the empire stood strong, mercantile
speculation was far-reaching and vigorous. But those engaged
in this line of business would seldom be able to find large sums in
ready cash at short notice. Hence to them, as to spendthrifts, the
sudden calling in of mortgages was a grave inconvenience.</p>

<p>The picture of the wily capitalists, hoarding their money till the
‘slump’ in land-values had fully developed, is one of all ‘civilized’ peoples
and ages. What is notable on this particular occasion is the sequel
according to Tacitus. Once their design of profiting by their neighbours’
necessities was checked by the intervention of Tiberius, the investment
in real estate was no longer attractive. The Senate’s order was not enforced
and the money-lenders could, and did, reserve their ready cash for
use in some more remunerative form of investment. The slackness of the
Senate may have been partly due to careless neglect, as the words seem to
suggest. But it may be suspected that some members of that body had
private reasons for wishing the Order of the House not to be seriously
enforced. Tacitus remarks that, on the matter being laid before the
Fathers, they were thrown into a flutter, since there was hardly one
among them<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> that had not broken the law. This surely refers to the
time-honoured trick of Roman senators, who, forbidden to engage in
commerce (and money-lending was closely connected with commerce),
evaded the restriction in various ways, such as holding shares in companies
or lending through their freedmen as agents. So now, seeking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
a high rate of interest on their capital, they did not wish to lock up
any more of it in land. Most of them would already own enough real
estate for social purposes. From this episode we have some right to
infer that in the period of the early Empire it had already become clear
that very extensive landowning in Italy was an unwise policy for men
who wanted a large income. Yet the preferential position of Italy had
not ceased to be a fact; and even in the time of Trajan we have seen
an imperial ordinance bidding new senators from the Provinces to invest
⅓ of their fortunes in Italian land. This might raise prices for the
moment, but it had nothing directly to do with promoting agriculture.
Practical farming seems to have been passing more and more into the
hands of humbler persons, often freedmen, who treated it as a serious
business.</p>

<p>That the attention of Tacitus had been directed to the methods of
capitalists in Italy, and therewith to money-lending, landholding, and
slavery, may be gathered from the remarks on these subjects in his
<i>Germany</i>. He writes, as Herodotus and others had done before him,
taking particular notice of customs differing from those prevalent in
his own surroundings. Thus he notes<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> the absence of money-lending
at interest. He describes the system of communal ownership of land
by village-units, and its periodic redistribution among the members of
the community. The wide stretches of open plains<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> enable the Germans
to put fresh fields under tillage year by year, leaving the rest in fallow
(no doubt as rough pasture). Intensive culture is unknown. To wring
the utmost out of the soil by the sweat of their brow is not their aim:
they have no orchards or gardens or fenced paddocks, but are content
to raise a crop of corn. All this is in marked contrast with Italian
conditions. Even to get rid of fallows was an ambition of agriculturists
in Italy, and a rotation-system<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> had been devised to this end. And,
whatever may have been the case in prehistoric times, full property in
land had long been established by the Roman Law, and there was in
the Italian land-system no trace of redistribution for short terms of
use. In treating of slavery, the first point made is its connexion<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> with
the inveterate German habit of gambling. Losers will end by staking
their own freedom on a last throw; if this also fails, they will submit
to be fettered and sold. To the Roman this seems a false notion of
honour. He adds that to take advantage of this sort of slave-winning
is not approved by German sentiment: hence the winner combines<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>
scruples with profit by selling a slave of this class into foreign lands.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Other slaves are not employed in Roman fashion as an organized staff
of domestics. Each has a lodging and home of his own: his lord requires
of him a fixed rent<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> of so much corn or live-stock or clothing,
as of a tenant: and he renders no service beyond this. House-work is
done by a man’s own wife and family. Slaves are seldom flogged or
chained or put to task-work. The German may kill his slave, but it
will not be as a penalty for disobedience, but in a fit of rage. Freedmen
are of little more account than slaves, and are only of influence at the
courts of the kings who rule some of the tribes. There they rise above
the freeborn and noble: but in general the inferiority of freedmen
serves to mark the superiority of the freeborn.</p>

<p>Tacitus had held an important official post in Belgic Gaul or one
of the so-called ‘Germanies’ along the Rhine, and had been at pains
to learn all he could of the independent barbarians to the East. The
Rhine frontier was one of the Roman borders that needed most careful
watching, and Roman readers took an uneasy interest in the doings of
the warrior tribes whose numbers, in contrast to their own falling birth-rate,
were ever renewed and increased by alarming fertility. He was
not alone in perceiving the contrasts between Italian and German institutions
and habits, or in reading morals therefrom, expressed or
implied. Germans had been employed as mercenary soldiers by Julius
Caesar, and were destined to become one of the chief elements of the
Roman armies. But in Italy they were perhaps more directly known
as slaves. We have just seen that Tacitus speaks of a regular selling
of slaves over the German border, and another passage<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> incidentally
illustrates this fact in a curious manner. In the course of his conquest
of Britain, Agricola established military posts on the NW coast over
against Ireland. It seems to have been in one of these that a cohort
of Usipi were stationed. They had been raised in the Roman Germanies,
and apparently sent over in a hurry. Not liking the service,
they killed their officer and the old soldiers set to train them, seized
three vessels, and put to sea. After various adventures and sufferings
in a voyage round the north of Britain, they fell into the hands of some
tribes of northern Germany, who took them for pirates—those that
were left of them. Of the fate reserved for some of these Tacitus remarks
‘Some were sold as slaves<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> and, passing from purchaser to purchaser,
eventually reached the Roman bank (of the Rhine), where their extraordinary
story aroused much interest.’ Such were the strange possibilities
in the northern seas and lands where the Roman and the German met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<h4 id="note3">NOTE ON AN AFRICAN INSCRIPTION.</h4>

<p>It may be convenient to notice here an inscription<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> relative to irrigation in
Africa. In all parts of the empire subject to drought the supply of water to
farmers was a matter of importance, as it is in most Mediterranean countries
today. Good soils, that would otherwise have lain waste, were thus turned to
account. In the African Provinces much was done to meet this need, as the
remains of works for storage of water clearly testify. The period 69-180 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>
seems to have been marked by a considerable extension of cultivation in these
parts, and particularly in southern Numidia, which at that time was included in
the Province Africa. In this district, between Sitifis (Setif) and Trajan’s great
city Thamugadi (Timgad), lay the commune of Lamasba<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>, the members of
which appear to have been mainly engaged in agriculture. There has been preserved
a large portion of a great inscription dealing with the water-rights of their
several farms. There is nothing to suggest that the holders of these plots were
tenants under great landlords. They seem to be owners, not in the full sense of
Roman civil law, but on the regular provincial<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> footing, subject to tribute. To
determine the shares of the several plots in the common water-supply was probably
the most urgent problem of local politics in this community.</p>

<p>The date of the inscription has been placed in the reign of Elagabalus; but
it is obviously based on earlier conditions and not improbably a revision of an
earlier scheme. It deals with the several plots one by one, fixing the number
of hours<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> during which the water is to be turned on to each, and making allowance
for variation of the supply according to the season of the year. A remarkable
feature of this elaborate scheme is the division of the plots into those below
the water level into which the water finds its way by natural flow (<i>declives</i>), and
those above water level (<i>acclives</i>). To the latter it is clear that the water must
have been raised by mechanical means, and the scale of hours fixed evidently
makes allowance for the slower delivery accomplished thereby. For the ‘descendent’
water was to be left flowing for fewer hours than the ‘ascendent.’ As
a specimen of the care taken in such a community to prevent water-grabbing by
unscrupulous members this record is a document of high interest. That many
others of similar purport existed, and have only been lost to us by the chances
of time, is perhaps no rash guess.</p>

<p>The water-leet is called <i>aqua Claudiana</i>. The regulations are issued by the
local senate and people (<i>decreto ordinis et colonorum</i>), for the place had a local<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a>
government. Names of 43 possessors remain on the surviving portion of the
stone. In form they are generally Roman<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a>. It is noted that only three of them
have a <i>praenomen</i>. Of the quality of the men it is not easy to infer anything.
Some may perhaps have been Italians. Whether they, or some of them, were
working farmers must remain doubtful. At all events they do not seem to belong
to the class of <i>coloni</i> of whom we shall have to speak below, but to be strictly
cultivating possessors. What labour they employed it is hardly possible to guess.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">XXXVIII. FRONTINUS.</h3>

<p><b>Sextus Julius Frontinus</b>, a good specimen of the competent departmental
officers in the imperial service, was not only a distinguished
military commander but an engineer and a writer of some merit. His
little treatise<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> on the aqueducts of Rome has for us points of interest.
From it we can form some notion of the importance of the great water-works,
not only to the city but to the country for some miles in certain
directions. For water-stealing by the illicit tapping of the main channels
was practised outside as well as within the walls. Landowners<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> did it
to irrigate their gardens, and the underlings of the staff (<i>aquarii</i>) connived
at the fraud: to prevent this abuse was one of the troubles of the
<i>curator</i>. But in certain places water was delivered by branch supplies
from certain aqueducts. This of course had to be duly licensed, and
license was only granted when the flow of water in the particular aqueduct
was normally sufficient to allow the local privilege without reducing
the regular discharge in Rome. The municipality of Tibur<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>
seems to have had an old right to a branch of the <i>Anio vetus</i>. The
<i>aqua Crabra</i> had been a spring serving Tusculum<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>, but in recent times
the Roman <i>aquarii</i> had led off some of its water into the <i>Tepula</i>, and
made illicit profit out of the supply thus increased in volume. Frontinus
himself with the emperor’s approval redressed the grievance, and the
full supply of the <i>Crabra</i> again served the Tusculan landlords. The
jealous attention given to the water-works is illustrated by the decrees<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>
of the Senate in the time of the Republic and of emperors since, by
which grants of water-rights can only be made to individuals named
in the grant, and do not pass to heirs or assigns: the water must only
be drawn from the reservoir named, and used on the estate for which
the license is specifically granted.</p>

<p>The office of <i>curator aquarum</i> was manifestly no sinecure. It was
not merely that constant precautions had to be taken against the stealing
of the water. An immense staff<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> had to be kept to their duties,
and the cleansing and repair of the channels needed prompt and continuous
attention. And it seems that some of the landowners through
whose estates the aqueducts passed gave much trouble<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> to the administration.
Either they erected buildings in the strips of land reserved
as legal margin on each side of a channel, or they planted trees there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
thus damaging the fabric; or they drove local roads over it; or again
they blocked the access to working parties engaged in the duties of
upkeep. Frontinus quotes decrees of the Senate dealing with these
abuses and providing penalties for persons guilty of such selfish and
reckless conduct. But to legislate was one thing, to enforce the law
was another. Yet the unaccommodating<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> landlords had no excuse for
their behaviour. It was not a question of ‘nationalizing’ the side strips,
though that would have been amply justified in the interests of the
state. But the fact is that the old practice of Republican days was
extremely tender of private rights. If a landlord made objection to
selling a part of his estate, they took over the whole block and paid
him for it. Then they marked off the portions required for the service,
and resold the remainder. Thus the state was left unchallenged owner
of the part retained for public use. But the absence of any legal or
moral claim has not availed to stop encroachments: the draining away
of the water still goes on, with or without leave, and even the channels
and pipes themselves are pierced. No wonder that more severe and
detailed legislation was found necessary in the time of Augustus. The
writer ends by recognizing the unfairness of suddenly enforcing a law
the long disuse of which has led many to presume upon continued
impunity for breaking it. He therefore has been reviving it gradually,
and hopes that offenders will not force him to execute it with rigour.</p>

<p>What stands out clearly in this picture of the water-service is the
utter lack of public spirit imputed to the landowners near Rome by a
careful and responsible public servant of good repute. There is none
of the sermonizing of Seneca or the sneers and lamentations of Pliny.
Frontinus takes things as they are, finds them bad, and means to do
his best to improve them, while avoiding the temptations of the new
broom. That a great quantity of water was being, and had long been,
diverted from the public aqueducts to serve suburban villas and
gardens, is certain. What we do not learn is whether much or any of
this was used for the market-gardens of the humble folk who grew<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>
garden-stuff for the Roman market. It is the old story,—little or
nothing about the poor, save when in the form of a city rabble they
achieve distinction as a public burden and nuisance. It does however
seem fairly certain that licenses to abstract water were only granted
as a matter of special favour. Therefore, so far as licensed abstraction
went, it is most probable that influential owners of <i>suburbana</i> were the
only beneficiaries. Theft of water with connivance<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> of the staff was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
only possible for those who could afford to bribe. There remains the
alternative of taking it by eluding or defying the vigilance of the staff.
Is it probable that the poor market-gardener ventured to do this?
Not often, I fancy: we can only guess, and I doubt whether much of
the intercepted water came his way. There was it is true one aqueduct<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>
the water of which was of poor quality. It was a work of Augustus,
intended to supply the great pond (<i>naumachia</i>) in which sham sea-fights
were held to amuse the public. When not so employed, this water was
made available for irrigation of gardens. This was on the western or
Vatican side of the Tiber. Many rich men had pleasure-gardens in
that part, and we cannot be sure that even this water was in practice
serving any economic purpose.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">XXXIX. INSCRIPTIONS RELATIVE TO <i>ALIMENTA</i>.</h3>

<p>It is impossible to leave unnoticed the inscriptions<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> of this period
relative to <i>alimenta</i>, and Mommsen’s interpretation<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> of the two chief
ones, though their connexion with my present subject is not very close.
In the bronze tablets recording respectively the declarations of estate-values
in the communes of Ligures Baebiani (101 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>) and Veleia
(103 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>), made with the view of ascertaining the securities upon which
the capital endowment was to be advanced, we have interesting details
of this ingenious scheme for perpetuating charity. But neither these,
nor some minor inscribed records of bequests, nor again the experience
of Pliny the younger in a benefaction<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> of the same kind, give us direct
evidence on labour-questions. It is in connexion with tenure of land
and management of estates that these documents mainly concern us.
The fact that there was felt to be a call for charities to encourage the
rearing of children was assuredly not a sign of social or economic
wellbeing; but this I have remarked above.</p>

<p>The following points stand out clearly in the interpretation of
Mommsen. The growth of large estates as against small is shewn in
both the tablets as having gone far by the time of Trajan: but not so
far as modern writers have imagined. In the case of the Ligures
Baebiani there is record of a considerable number of properties of
moderate value, indeed they are in a majority. At Veleia, though
small estates have not disappeared, there are more large ones, and the
process of absorption has evidently been more active. This was not
strange, for the former case belongs to the Hirpinian hill country of
southern Italy, the latter to the slopes of the Apennine near Placentia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
including some of the rich plain of the Po. The latter would naturally
attract capital more than the former. I have more than once remarked
that in the upland districts agricultural conditions were far less revolutionized
than in the lowlands. This seems to be an instance in point:
but the evidence is not complete. There is nothing to shew that the
estates named in these tablets were the sole landed properties of their
several owners. Nor is it probable. To own estates in different parts
of the country was a well understood policy of landlords. How we are
to draw conclusions as to the prevalence of great estates from a few
isolated local instances, without a statement of the entire landed properties
of the persons named, I cannot see. That writers of the Empire,
when they speak of <i>latifundia</i>, are seldom thinking of the crude and
brutal plantation-system of an earlier time, is very true. Those vast
arable farms with their huge slave-gangs were now out of fashion, and
Mommsen points out that our records are practically silent as to
large-scale arable farming. We are not to suppose that it was extinct,
but it was probably rare.</p>

<p>The most valuable part of this paper is its recognition of the vital
change in Italian agriculture, the transfer of farming from a basis of
ownership to one of tenancy. The yeoman or owner-cultivator of olden
time had been driven out or made a rare figure in the most eligible
parts of Italy. The great plantations, which had largely superseded
the small-scale farms, had in their turn proved economic failures. Both
these systems, in most respects strongly contrasted, had one point in
common: the land was cultivated by or for the owner, and for his own
account. But the failure of the large-scale plantation-system did not
so react as to bring back small ownership. Large ownership still remained,
supported as it was by the social importance attached to
landowning, and occasionally by governmental action directed to
encourage investment in Italian land. Large owners long struggled to
keep their estates in hand under stewards farming for their masters’
account. But this plan was doomed to failure, because the care and
attention necessary to make it pay were in most cases greater than
landlords were willing to bestow. By Columella’s time this fact was
already becoming evident. He could only advise the landlords to be
other than he found them, and meanwhile point to an alternative,
namely application of the tenancy-system. It was this latter plan that
more and more found favour. The landlord could live in town and
draw his rents, himself free to pursue his own occupations. The tenant-farmer
was only bound by the terms of his lease; and, being resident,
was able to exact the full labour of his staff and prevent waste and
robbery. The custom was for the landlord to provide<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> the equipment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
(<i>instrumentum</i>) of the farm, or at least most of it, including slaves.
Thus he was in a sense partner of his tenant, finding most of the
working capital. Whether he had a claim to a money rent only, or to
a share of crops also, depended on the terms of letting. It seems that
rents were often in arrear, and that attempts to recover sums due by
selling up tenants’ goods did not always cover the debts.</p>

<p>The typical tenant-farmer was certainly a ‘small man.’ To let the
whole of a large estate to a ‘big man’ with plenty of capital was not
the practice in Italy. Why? I think the main reason was that a big
capitalist who wanted to get the highest return on his money could at
this time do better for himself in other ventures: if set upon a land-enterprise,
he could find far more attractive openings in some of the
Provinces. Anyhow, as Mommsen says, ‘Grosspacht’ never became
acclimatized in Italy, though we find it on Imperial domains, for instance
in Africa. In connexion with this matter I am led to remark
that small tenancy ‘Kleinpacht’ seems to have existed in two forms,
perhaps indistinguishable in law, but different in their practical effect.
When a landlord, letting parcels of a big estate to tenants, kept in
hand the chief <i>villa</i> and its appurtenances as a sort of Manor Farm,
and tenants fell into arrear with their rent, he had a ready means of
indemnifying himself without ‘selling up’ his old tenants and having
possibly much difficulty in finding better new ones. He could commute
arrears of rent into obligations of service<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> on the Manor Farm.
Most tenants would probably be only too glad to get rid of the immediate
burden of debt. It would seem a better course than to borrow
for that purpose money on which interest would have to be paid, even
supposing that anyone would be willing to lend to a poor tenant confessedly
in difficulties. And such an arrangement would furnish the
landlord with a fixed amount of labour (and labour was becoming
scarcer) on very favourable terms—he or his agent would see to that.
But it was not really necessary to reserve a ‘Manor Farm’ at all, and
a man owning land in several districts would hardly do so in every
estate, if in any. Such a landlord could not readily solve the arrears-problem
by commutation. He was almost compelled<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> to ‘sell up’ a
hopeless defaulter: and, since most of the stock had probably been
supplied by himself, there would not be much for him to sell. That
such cases did occur, we know for certain; the old tenant went, being
free to move, and to find a good new one was no easy matter, particularly
as the land was sure to have been left in a bad state. Arrears of
farm-rents had a regular phrase (<i>reliqua colonorum</i>) assigned to them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
and there is good reason to believe that they were a common source
of trouble. It has been well said<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> that landlords in Italy were often as
badly off as their tenants. The truth is that the whole agricultural
interest was going downhill.</p>

<p>If the tenant-farmer was, as we see, becoming more and more the
central figure of Italian agriculture, we must next inquire how he stood
in relation to labour. It is <i>a priori</i> probable that a man will be more
ready to work with his own hands on a farm of his own than on one
hired: no man is more alive to the difference of <i>meum</i> and <i>alienum</i>
than the tiller of the soil. It is therefore not wonderful that we find
tenant-farmers employing slave labour. From the custom of having
slaves as well as other stock supplied by the landlord we may fairly
infer that tenants were, at least generally, not to be had on other
terms. Mommsen remarks<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> that actual handwork on the land was
more and more directed rather than performed by the small tenants.
Thus it came to be more and more done by unfree persons. This recognizes,
no doubt rightly, that the system of great estates let in portions
to tenants was not favourable to a revival of free rustic labour,
but told effectively against it. He also points out<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> that under Roman
Law it was possible for a landlord and his slave to stand in the mutual
relation of lessor and lessee. Such a slave lessee is distinct from the
free tenant <i>colonus</i>. It appears that there were two forms of this relation.
The slave might be farming on his own<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> account, paying a rent
and taking the farm-profits as his <i>peculium</i>. In this case he is in the
eye of the law <i>quasi colonus</i>. Or he might be farming on his master’s
account; then he is <i>vilicus</i>. In both cases he is assumed to have under
him slave-labourers supplied<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> by the landlord, and it seems that the
name <i>vilicus</i> was sometimes loosely applied even in the former case.
In the latter case he cannot have been very different from the steward
of a large estate worked for owner’s account. I can only conclude that
he was put in charge of a smaller farm-unit and left more to his own
devices. Probably this arrangement would be resorted to only when an
ordinary free tenant was not to be had; and satisfactory ones were
evidently not common in the time of the younger Pliny.</p>

<p>So far as I can see, in this period landlords were gradually ceasing
to keep a direct control over the management of their own estates, but
the changes in progress did not tend to a rehabilitation of free labour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
One detail needs a brief special consideration. The landlord’s agent
(<i>actor</i>) is often mentioned, and it is clear that the <i>actor</i> was generally
a slave. But there is reference to the possible case<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> of an <i>actor</i> living
(like his master) in town, not on the farms, and having a wife<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> and
daughter. This suggests a freedman, not a slave, and such cases may
have been fairly numerous. Another point for notice is the question of
<i>vincti, alligati, compediti</i>, in this period. Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> treats the chaining
of field-slaves as being quite exceptional, in fact a punishment, in Italy
under the Empire. Surely it was always in some sense a punishment.
From what Columella<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> says of the normal employment of chained
labourers in vineyard-work I can not admit that the evidence justifies
Mommsen’s assertion. That there was a growing reluctance to use
such barbarous methods, and that local usage varied in various parts
of the country, is certain.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XL">XL. DION CHRYSOSTOM.</h3>

<p>We have seen that there is no lack of evidence as to the lamentable
condition of Italian agriculture in a large part of the country. But
things were no better in certain Provinces, more particularly in Greece.
Plutarch deplores<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> the decay and depopulation of his native land, but
the most vivid and significant picture preserved to us is one conveyed
in a public address<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> by the famous lecturer <b>Dion of Prusa</b>, better
known as Dion<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> Chrysostom. It describes conditions in the once prosperous
island of Euboea. The speaker professes to have been cast
ashore there in a storm, and to have been entertained with extraordinary
kindness by some honest rustics who were living an industrious
and harmless life in the upland parts, the rocky shore of which
was notorious as a scene of shipwrecks. There were two connected
households, squatters in the lonely waste, producing by their own exertions
everything they needed, and of course patterns of every amiable
virtue. The lecturer recounts the story of these interesting people as
told him by his host. How much of it is due to his own imagination,
or put together out of various stories, we cannot judge: but it is manifest
that what concerns us is to feel satisfied that the experiences described
were possible, and not grotesquely improbable, in their setting
of place and time. I venture to accept the story as a sketch of what
might very well have happened, whether it actually did so or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>We live mostly by the chase, said the hunter, with very little tillage.
This croft (χωρίον) does not belong to us either by inheritance or purchase.
Our fathers, though freemen, were poor like ourselves, just hired
herdsmen, in charge of the herds of a rich man who owned wide farm-lands
and all these mountains. When he died, his estate was confiscated:
It is said that the emperor<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> made away with him to get his
property. Well, they drove off his live-stock for slaughter, and our few
oxen with them, and never paid our wages. So we did the best we
could, taking advantage of the resources of the neighbourhood in
summer and winter. Since childhood I have only once visited the
city<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>. A man turned up one day demanding money. We had none,
and I told him so on my oath. He bade me come with him to the city.
There I was arraigned before the mob as a squatter on the public land,
without a grant from the people, and without any payment. It was
hinted that we were wreckers, and had put together a fine property
through that wicked trade. We were said to have valuable farms and
abundance of flocks and herds, beasts of burden, slaves. But a wiser
speaker took a different line. He urged that those who turned the
public land to good account were public benefactors and deserved encouragement.
He pointed out that two thirds of their territory was
lying waste through neglect and lack of population. He was himself
a large landowner: whoever was willing to cultivate his land was welcome
to do so free of charge,—indeed he would reward him for his
pains—the improvement would be worth it. He proposed a plan for
inducing citizens to reclaim the derelict lands, rent-free for ten years,
and after that rented at a moderate share of the crops. To aliens less
favourable terms might be offered, but with a prospect of citizenship
in case of reclamation on a large scale. By such a policy the evils of
idleness and poverty would be got rid of. These considerations he enforced
by pointing to the pitiful state of the city itself. Outside the
gates you find, not a suburb but a hideous desert. Within the walls we
grow crops and graze beasts on the sites of the gymnasium and the
market-place. Statues of gods and heroes are smothered in the growing
corn. Yet we are forsooth to expel these hard-working folks and
to leave men nothing to do but to rob or steal.</p>

<p>The rustic, being called upon to state his own case, described the
poverty of the squatter families, the innocence of their lives, their services
to shipwrecked seafarers, and so forth. On the last topic he
received a dramatic confirmation from a man in the crowd, who had
himself been one of a party of castaways hospitably relieved three years
before by these very people. So all ended well. The stress laid on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
simple rusticity of the rustic, and the mutual distrust and mean jealousy
of the townsfolk, shew in numerous touches that we have in this narrative
a highly coloured scene. But the picture of the decayed city, with
its ancient walls a world too wide for its shrunk population, is companion
to that of the deserted countryside. Both panels of this mournful
diptych could have been paralleled in the case of many a city and territory
in Italy and Greece. The moral reflexions, in which the lecturer
proceeds to apply the lessons of the narrative, are significant. He enlarges
on the superiority of the poor to the rich in many virtues, unselfishness
in particular. Poverty in itself is not naturally an evil. If
men will only work with their own hands, they may supply their own
needs, and live a life worthy of freemen. The word αὐτουργεῖν occurs
more than once in this spirited appeal, shewing clearly that Dion had
detected the plague-spot in the civilization of his day. But he honestly
admits the grave difficulties that beset artisans in the various trades
practised in towns. They lack necessary<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> capital: everything has to
be paid for, food clothing lodging fuel and what not, for they get
nothing free but water, and own nothing but their bodies. Yet we cannot
advise them to engage in foul degrading vocations. We desire them
to live honourably, not to sink below the standards of the greedy
usurer or the owners of lodging-houses or ships or gangs of slaves.
What then are we to do with the decent poor? Shall we have to propose
turning them out of the cities and settling them on allotments in
the country? Tradition tells us rural settlement prevailed throughout
Attica of yore: and the system worked well, producing citizens of a
better and more discreet type than the town-bred mechanics who
thronged the Assemblies and law-courts of Athens.</p>

<p>It may be said that Dion is a mere itinerant philosopher, who
travels about seeing the world and proposing impracticable remedies
for contemporary evils in popular sermons to idle audiences. But he
knew his trade, and his trade was to make his hearers ‘feel better’ for
attending his discourses. When he portrays the follies or vices of the
age, he is dealing with matters of common knowledge, and not likely
to misrepresent facts seriously. When he suggests remedies, it matters
little that there is no possibility of applying them. Present company
are always excepted, and the townsfolk who listened to the preacher
would neither resent his strictures on city life nor have the slightest
intention of setting their own hands to the spade or plough. That
there was a kind of moral reaction<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> in this period, and that lecturers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
and essayists contributed something to the revival of healthier public
sentiment, I do not dispute; though I think too much success is sometimes<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a>
ascribed to their good intentions. At any rate they cannot be
credited with improving the conditions of rustic life. To the farmer the
voice of the great world outside was represented by the collectors of
rents and taxes, the exactors of services, not by the sympathetic homilies
of popular teachers.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLI">XLI. NEW TESTAMENT WRITERS.</h3>

<p>The authors of the books of the New Testament, whom it is convenient
to view together as a group of witnesses bearing on the condition
of a part of the Roman East under the early Empire, supply some
interesting matter. We read of an agriculture that includes corn-growing,
the culture of vines, and pastoral industry: the olive, and
above all the fig-tree, appear as normal objects of the countryside.
Plough spade and sickle, storehouse threshing-floor and winepress, are
the familiar appliances of rustic life, as they had been from time immemorial.
Farmers need not only hard work, but watchfulness and
forethought, for the business of their lives. Live stock have to be protected
from beasts of prey, and need endless care. And the rustic’s
outlook is ever clouded by the fear of drought and murrain. All this
is an ordinary picture, common to many lands: only the anxiety about
water-supply is perhaps specially Oriental. The ox and the ass are the
chief beasts of draught and burden. In short, country life goes on as
of old, and much as it still does after many changes of rulers.</p>

<p>From the way in which farmers are generally spoken of I infer that
they are normally peasant<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> landowners. That is to say, not tenants of
an individual landlord, but holding their farms with power of sale and
right of succession, liable to tribute. The Roman state is strictly
speaking the owner, having succeeded to the royal ownership assumed
by the Seleucid kings. But that there was also letting<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> of estates to
tenant-farmers is clear, for we read of collection of rents. At the same
time we find it suggested, apparently as a moral rather than legal
obligation, that the toiling farmer has the first claim<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> on the produce,
and the ox is not to be muzzled. Such passages, and others insisting
on honesty and the duty of labour, keep us firmly reminded of the
moral aims pervading the works of these writers. In other words, they
are more concerned to define what ought to be than to record what is.
Many of the significant references to rustic matters occur in parables.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
But we must not forget that a parable would have little force if its
details were not realistic.</p>

<p>Of the figures appearing on the agricultural scene we may distinguish
the wealthy landlord<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a>, whether farming for his own account
or letting his land to tenants: the steward<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> farming for his lord’s
account: the tenant-farmer: probably the free peasant on a small
holding of his own. Labour is represented by the farmer working with
his own hands, and by persons employed simply as labourers. These
last are either freemen or slaves. Slavery is assumed as a normal condition,
but a reader can hardly help being struck by the notable passages
in which the wage-earner appears as a means of illustrating an
important point. Does the occurrence of such passages suggest that in
these Oriental surroundings wage-service was as common a system as
bond-service, perhaps even more so? I hesitate to draw this conclusion,
for the following reason. Accepting the fact of slavery (as the writers
do), there was not much to be said beyond enjoining humanity on
masters and conscientious and respectful service on slaves. But the
relation between hirer and hired, presumably a bargain, opened up
far-reaching issues of equity, transcending questions of formal law.
Hence we hear much about it. That the workman is worthy of his
meat (ἐργάτης ... τροφῆς) is a proposition of which we have an earlier<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a>
version, referring to slaves. The cowardice of the hireling shepherd
points a notable moral. The rich who defraud the reaper of his hire<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>
meet with scathing denunciation. For to him that worketh the reward
is not reckoned<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> of grace but of debt.</p>

<p>This last proposition seems to furnish a key to the remarkable
parable<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> of the Labourers in the Vineyard, which has been subjected
to many diverse interpretations. If we accept the view that the wages
represent the Kingdom of God, and that this reward is granted not of
debt but of grace, it is clear that great stress is laid on the autocratic
position of the householder (οἰκοδεσπότης). His treatment of the hired
labourers is an assertion of entire indifference to what we call ‘economic’
considerations. How it is to be interpreted as equitable, theologians
must decide, or be content to leave modern handworkers to draw their
own conclusions. My interest in the matter may be shewn in the question
whether this householder is to be regarded as a typical figure, or
not. I trust I am guilty of no irreverence in saying that to me he
seems a purely hypothetical character. That is to say that I take the
gist of the parable to be this: if an employer chose to deal with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
hirelings on such arbitrary principles, he would be acting within his
rights. I do not infer that such conduct was likely in ordinary life, or
even that a concrete case of its occurrence had ever been known. I
cannot believe that in a country where debts<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> and usury are referred
to as matters of course, and where masters entrusted money<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> to their
slaves for purposes of trade, where sales of land<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> were an ordinary
business transaction, a sane individualistic capitalist would act as the
man in this parable. Those who think differently must clear up their
own difficulties. I would add that this parable, the details of which
seem to me non-realistic, only occurs in one of the Gospels. Is it possible
that it is based on some current Oriental story?</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLII">XLII. MARTIAL AND JUVENAL.</h3>

<p>Among the witnesses, other than technical writers, from whom we
get evidence as to the conditions of agriculture under the Empire, are
two poets, Martial and Juvenal. The latter, a native of Aquinum in
the old Volscian part of Latium, never shook off the influence of his
connexion with rural Italy. The former, a native of Bilbilis in Spain,
was one of the gifted provincials who came to Rome as the literary
centre of the world. He spent more than thirty years there, and made
an unrivalled name as a writer of epigrams, but his heart was in Spain.
The attitude of these two men towards the facts of their time is very
different, and the difference affects the value of their evidence. In the
satires of Juvenal indignant rhetoric takes up a high moral position,
and declaims fiercely against abominations. Now this attitude is beset
with temptations to overstate an evil rather than weaken effect. Moreover,
in imperial Rome it was necessary to be very careful: not only
were personal references dangerous, but it was above all things necessary
to avoid provoking the Emperor. Yet even Emperors could (and
did) view attacks upon their predecessors with indifference or approval:
while vicious contemporaries were not likely to put on the cap if their
deceased counterparts were assailed. So the satirist, confining his
strictures mainly to the past, is not often a contemporary witness of
the first order. It is fortunate that his references to rustic conditions
are not much affected by this limitation: but they mostly refer to the
past. <b>Martial</b> on the contrary is a mere man of his time. His business is
not to censure, still less to reform, but to find themes for light verse
such as will hit the taste of average Roman readers. He soon discovered
that scandal was the one staple topic of interest, and exploited
it as a source of ‘copy’ down to the foulest dregs. Most of the characters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
exposed appear under fictitious Greek names, but doubtless Roman
gossips applied the filthy imputations to each other. We need not
suppose that Martial’s ruling passion was for bawdy epigram. But he
knew what would hit the taste of an idle and libidinous world. For
himself, nothing is clearer than that he found life in the great city a
sore trial, not solely from the oppressive climate at certain seasons of
the year. He was too clever a man not to suffer weariness in such
surroundings. He had to practice the servility habitually displayed by
poor men towards the rich and influential, but he did not like it. It
seems to have been through patronage that he got together sufficient
wealth to enable him eventually to retire to his native country. The
din and dirt and chronic unrest of Rome were to him, as to Juvenal,
an abomination: and from these ever-present evils there was, for
dwellers in mean houses or crowded blocks of sordid flats, no escape.
Both writers agree that the Rome of those days was only fit for the
wealthy to live in. Secure in his grand mansion on one of the healthiest
sites, with plenty of elbow-room, guarded against unwelcome intrusions
by a host of slaves and escorted by them in public, the millionaire
could take his life easily: he could even sleep. Martial had his way to
make as a man of letters, and needed to keep brain and nerves in
working order. For this, occasional retirement from the urban pandemonium
was necessary. So he managed to acquire a little suburban<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a>
property, where he could spend days in peace and quiet. Many of his
friends did the same. To keep such a place, however small, in good
order, and to grow some country produce, however little, it was
necessary to have a resident<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> <i>vilicus</i>. He had also a <i>vilica</i>, and there
would probably be a slave or two under them. The poet was now better
off, and doing as others did. These <i>suburbana</i>, retreats for the weary,
were evidently numerous. Their agricultural significance was small.
Martial often pokes fun at the owners who withdraw to the country for
a holiday, taking with them<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> their supplies of eatables bought in the
markets of Rome. Clearly the city markets were well supplied: and
this indicates the existence of another class of suburban properties,
market-gardens on a business footing, of which we hear little directly.
An industry of this kind springs up round every great centre of
population: how far it can extend depends on the available means of
delivering the produce in fair marketable condition. Round Rome it
had no doubt existed for centuries, and was probably one of the most
economically sound agricultural undertakings in central Italy. That it
was conducted on a small scale and was prosperous may be the reason
why it attracted little notice in literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>Though Martial cannot be regarded as an authority on Italian
agriculture, it so happens that passages of his works are important and
instructive, particularly in connexion with matters of land-management
and farm-labour. He gives point to his epigrams by short and vivid
touches, above all by telling contrasts. Now this style of writing loses
most of its force if the details lack reality. He was therefore little
tempted to go beyond the truth in matters of ordinary non-bestial life,
such as agricultural conditions; we may accept him as a good witness.
To begin with an all-important topic, let us see what we get from him
on the management of land, either for the landlord’s account under a
slave <i>vilicus</i>, or by letting it to a free <i>colonus</i>. In explaining the gloomy
bearing of Selius, he remarks<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> that it is not due to recent losses: his
wife and his goods and his slaves are all safe, and he is not suffering
from any failures of a tenant or a steward. Here <i>colonus</i> as opposed to
<i>vilicus</i> must mean a free tenant, who might be behindhand with his
rent or with service due under his lease. The opposition occurs elsewhere,
as when he refers<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> to the produce sent in to a rich man in Rome
from his country estates by his steward or tenant. So too on the birthday
of an eminent advocate all his clients and dependants send gifts;
among them<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> the hunter sends a hare, the fisherman some fish, and the
<i>colonus</i> a kid. The <i>venator</i> and <i>piscator</i> are very likely his slaves. In
protesting<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> against the plague of kissing as it strikes a man on return
to Rome, he says, ‘all the neighbours kiss you, and the <i>colonus</i> too with
his hairy unsavoury mouth.’ It seems to imply that the rustic tenant
would come to Town to pay his respects to his landlord. Barring the
kiss, the duty of welcoming the squire makes one think of times not
long gone by in England. In one passage<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> there is a touch suggestive
of almost medieval relations. How Linus has managed to get through
a large inherited fortune, is a mystery in need of an explanation. He
has not been a victim of the temptations of the great wicked city. No,
he has always lived in a country town, where economy was not only
possible but easy. Everything he needed was to be had cheap or gratis,
and there was nothing to lead him into extravagant ways. Now among
the instances of cheapness is the means of satisfying his sexual passions
when they become unruly. At such moments either the <i>vilica</i> or the
<i>duri nupta coloni</i> served his turn. The steward’s consort would be his
slave, and there is no more to be said: but the tenant-farmer’s wife,
presumably a free woman, is on a different footing. There is no suggestion
of hoodwinking the husband, for the situation is treated as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
a matter of course. It would rather seem that the landlord is represented
as relying on the complaisance of a dependent boor. If I interpret the
passage rightly, we have in it a vivid sidelight on the position of some
at least of the <i>coloni</i> of the first century <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. That <i>vilici</i> and <i>coloni</i> alike
were usually clumsy rustics of small manual skill, is suggested by two
passages<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> in which they are credited with bungling workmanship in
wood or stone. Perhaps we may detect reference to a <i>colonus</i> in an
epigram on a man who spends his money lavishly on his own debaucheries
but is meanly niggardly to necessitous friends. It says ‘you
sell ancestral lands to pay for a passing gratification of your lust, while
your friend, left in the lurch, is tilling land<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> that is not his own.’ That
is, you might have made him a present of a little farm, as many another
has done; but you have left him to sink into a mere <i>colonus</i>. Enough
has now been said to shew that these tenant-farmers were a humble
and dependent class of men, and that the picture drawn from passages
of Martial corresponds to that drawn above in Weber’s interpretation
of Columella.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to set out with the same fulness all the evidence
of Martial on agricultural matters regarded from various points of view.
The frequent reference to the land is a striking fact: like his fellow-countryman
Columella, he was clearly interested in the land-system of
Italy. He shews wide knowledge of the special products of different
districts; a knowledge probably picked up at first in the markets of
Rome, and afterwards increased by experience. No writer draws the
line more distinctly between productive and unproductive estates. That
we hear very much more of the latter is no wonder: so long as the
supremacy of Rome was unshaken, and money poured into Italy, a
great part of the country was held by wealthy owners to whom profit
was a less urgent motive than pleasure or pride. To what lengths ostentation
could go is seen<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> in the perverse fancy of a millionaire to have
a real <i>rus in urbe</i> with grounds about his town house so spacious that
they included a real vineyard: here in sheltered seclusion he could have
a vintage in Rome. This is in truth the same vulgar ambition as that
(much commoner) of the man who prides himself on treating guests
at his country mansion to every luxury procurable in Rome. It is
merely inverted.</p>

<p>At this point it is natural to ask whence came the vast sums lavished
on these and other forms of luxury. Italy was not a great manufacturing
country. The regular dues from the Provinces flowed into the
treasuries, not openly into private pockets. Yet a good deal of these
monies no doubt did in the end become the reward of individuals, as
salaries or amounts payable to contractors, etc. These however would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
not by themselves suffice to account for the immense squandering that
evidently took place. A source of incomes, probably much more productive
than we might at first sight imagine, existed in the huge estates
owned by wealthy Romans in the lands beyond the seas. Martial refers<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a>
to such properties at Patrae in Achaia, in Egypt, etc. The returns
from these estates, however badly managed, were in the total probably
very large. And they were no new thing. In Varro and in Cicero’s
letters we find them treated as a matter of course: the case of Atticus
and his lands in Epirus is well known. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> tells us of the case of
Pompey, and also of the six land-monopolizers whom Nero found in
possession of 50% of the Province of Africa. The practice of usury in
the subject countries was no longer so widespread or so remunerative
as it had been in the last period of the Republic, but it had not ceased,
and the same is true of the farming of revenues. Commerce was active:
but we are rather concerned with the means of paying for imported
goods than with the fact of importation. The anxiety as to the supply
of corn from abroad shews itself in the gossip<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> of quidnuncs as to the
fleet of freight-ships coming from Alexandria. Puteoli and Ostia were
doubtless very busy; all we need note is that someone must have made
money<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> in the business of transport and delivery. These considerations
may serve to explain the presence of so much ‘money in the country’
as we say, and the resulting extravagance. But all this social and
economic fabric rested on the security guaranteed by the imperial forces
on land and sea.</p>

<p>One of Martial’s epigrams<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> is of special interest as describing a
manifestly exceptional estate. It was at or near Baiae, the famous
seaside pleasure-resort, which had been the scene of costly fancies and
luxurious living for more than a hundred years. The point of the poem
lies in the striking contrast of this place compared with the unproductive
<i>suburbanum</i><a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> of another owner, which is kept going by supplies
from the Roman market. For the place is a genuine unsophisticated
country farm, producing corn and wine and good store of firewood, and
breeding cattle swine sheep and various kinds of poultry and pigeons.
When rustic neighbours come to pay their respects, they bring presents,
such as honey in the comb, cheese, dormice, a kid, a capon. The
daughters<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> of honest tenants bring baskets of eggs. The <i>villa</i> is a centre
of hospitality; even the slaves are well fed. The presence of a slave-household
brought from Town is particularly dwelt on: what with
fishing and trapping and with ‘light work’ in the garden, these spoilt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
menials, even my lord’s pet eunuch, are happy enough. There are also
young home-bred slaves (<i>vernae</i>) probably the offspring of the farm-slaves.
The topsyturvydom of this epigram is so striking that one may
suspect Martial of laughing in his sleeve at the eccentric friend whose
farm he is praising. In any case this cannot be taken seriously as a
realistic picture of a country seat practically agricultural. The owner
evidently drew his income from other sources. And the sort of man
who treated himself to an eunuch can hardly have been much of a
farmer, even near Baiae. The mention of <i>probi coloni</i> illustrates what
has been said above as to tenants, and that a farm could be described
in such words as <i>rure vero barbaroque</i> is a candid admission that in too
many instances a place of the kind could only by courtesy be styled a
farm, since the intrusion of ‘civilization’ (that is, of refined and luxurious
urban elements) destroyed its practical rustic character. That the estate
in question produced enough to feed the owner and his guests, his domestics
brought from Rome, and the resident rustic staff as well, is
credible. But there is nothing to shew that it produced any surplus for
the markets: it may have done something in this direction, but that it
really paid its way, yielding a moderate return on the capital sunk in
land slaves and other farm-stock, is utterly incredible.</p>

<p>Whether in town or country, the life sketched by Martial is that
of a society resting on a basis of slavery. At the same time the supply
of new slaves<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> was not so plentiful as it had been in days before the
Roman Peace under Augustus. Serviceable rustic slaves were valuable
nowadays. Addressing Faustinus, the wealthy owner of the above
Baian <i>villa</i> and several others, the poet says ‘you can send this book<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>
to Marcellinus, who is now at the end of his campaign in the North
and has leisure to read: but let your messenger be a dainty Greek
page. Marcellinus will requite you by sending you a slave, captive
from the Danube country, who has the making of a shepherd in him,
to tend the flocks on your estate by Tibur.’ Each friend is to send the
other what the other lacks and he is in a position to supply. This is a
single instance; but the suggested <i>do ut des</i> is significant. As wars
became rarer, and prisoners fewer, the disposal of captives would be a
perquisite of more and more value. That the normal treatment of
slaves was becoming more and more humane, is certain. But whether
humanitarian sentiment in Stoic forms, as preached by Seneca and
others, had much to do with this result, is more doubtful. The wisdom
of not provoking discontent among the slaves, particularly in the
country, was well understood. The decline of the free rustic population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
had made the absence of a regular police force a danger not to
be ignored. Improved conditions were probably in most cases due to
self-interest and caution much more than to humane sentiment. In
Martial’s day we may gather from numerous indications that in general
the lot of slaves was not a hard one if we except the legal right of
self-disposal. Urban domestics were often sadly spoilt, and were apt
to give themselves great airs outside the house or to callers at the door.
But I believe that in respect of comfort and happiness the position of
a steward with a slave-staff in charge of a country place owned by a
rich man was in most cases far pleasanter. Subject to the preparation
for the master’s occasional visits and entertainment of his guests, these
men were left very much to their own devices. The site of the <i>villa</i>
had been chosen for its advantages. So long as enough work was done
to satisfy the owner, they, his caretakers, enjoyed gratis for the whole
year<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> the privileges and pleasures which he paid for dearly and seldom
used.</p>

<p>It seems certain that it was on such estates that most of the slave-breeding
took place. It was becoming a more regular practice, as we
see from Columella. And it had advantages from several points of
view. The slave allowed to mate with a female partner and produce
children was more effectively tied to the place than the unmated
labourer on a plantation was by his chain. So long as the little <i>vernae</i>
were not brutally treated (and it seems to have been a tradition to
treat them well), the parents were much less likely to join in any rebellious
schemes. And, after all, the young of slaves were worth
money, if sold; while, if kept by the old master, they would work in
what was the only home they had known: they would be easier to
train and manage than some raw barbarian from Germany or Britain
or the Sudan. But it must not be forgotten that the recognition of
slave-breeding foreboded the eventual decline of slavery—personal
slavery—as an institution, at least for purposes of rustic life. I know
of no direct evidence<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> as to the class or classes from which the unfree
<i>coloni</i> of the later Empire were drawn. But it seems to me extremely
probable that many of the <i>coloni</i> of the period with which we are just
now concerned were home-bred slaves manumitted and kept on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
estate as tenants. This conjecture finds a reason for manumission, as
the freedman would be capable of a legal relation, which the slave was
not. The freedman’s son would be <i>ingenuus</i>, and would represent, in
his economic bondage under cover of legal freedom, a natural stage in
the transition from the personal slave to the predial serf.</p>

<p>That there were <i>vernae</i> on the small suburban properties, the rest-retreats
of Martial and many others, is not to be doubted. But they
can hardly have been very numerous. These little places were often
but poorly kept up. The owners were seldom wealthy men, able to
maintain many slaves. Economy and quiet were desired by men who
could not afford ostentation. The normal use of the epithet <i>sordidus</i><a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a>
(not peculiar to Martial) in speaking of such places, and indeed of small
farmsteads in general, is characteristic of them and of the undress life
led there. The house was sometimes in bad condition. To patch up a
leaky roof<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> a present of a load of tiles was welcome. A man buys a
place the house (<i>casa</i>) on which is horribly dark and old: the poet
remarks that it is close to the pleasure-garden (<i>hortos</i>) of a rich man.
This explains the purchase: the buyer will put up with bad lodging
for the prospect of good dinners at his neighbour’s table. The difficulty
of finding a purchaser for an estate of bad sanitary record, and the
damage done to riparian farms by the Tiber floods, are instances<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> of
the ordinary troubles of the little landowners near Rome. A peculiar
nuisance, common in Italy, was the presence in some corner of a field
of the tomb<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> of some former owner or his family. A slice of the land,
so many feet in length and breadth, was often reserved<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> as not to pass
with the inheritance. What the heir never owned, that he could not
sell. So, when the property changed hands, the new owner had no
right to remove what to him might be nothing but a hindrance to
convenient tillage. Altars<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> taken over from a predecessor may also
have been troublesome at times, but their removal was probably less
difficult.</p>

<p>The picture of agricultural conditions to be drawn from <b>Juvenal</b>
agrees with that drawn from Martial. But, as said above, the point of
view is different in the satirist, whose business it is to denounce evils,
and who is liable to fall into rhetorical exaggeration. And to a native
of central Italy the tradition of a healthier state of things in earlier ages
was naturally a more important part of his background than it could
be to a man from Spain. Hence we find vivid scenes<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> drawn from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
legend, shewing good old Romans, men of distinction, working on the
land themselves and rearing well-fed families (slaves included) on the
produce of meagre little plots of two <i>iugera</i>. An ex-consul<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> breaks off
his labours on a hillside, shoulders his mattock, and joins a rustic feast
at the house of a relative. The hill-folk of the Abruzzi are patterns of
thrifty contentment, ready to earn their bread<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> with the plough. But
the civic duties are not forgotten. The citizen has a double function.
He serves the state in arms and receives a patch of land<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> as his reward
for wounds suffered. He has to attend the Assembly before his wounds<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a>
are fully healed. In short, he is a peasant soldier who does a public
duty in both peace and war. The vital need of the present day<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> is
that parents should rear sons of this type. Here we have the moral
which these scenes, and the frequent references to ancient heroes, are
meant to impress on contemporaries. A striking instance<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> from historical
times is that of Marius, who is represented as having risen from
the position of a wage-earning farm-labourer to be the saviour of
Rome from the barbarians of the North. But the men of the olden
time led simple lives, free from the extravagance and luxury of these
days and therefore from the temptations and ailments that now
abound. The only wholesome surroundings<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> now are to be found in
out-of-the way country corners or the homes of such frugal citizens as
Juvenal himself. But these are mere islets in a sea of wantonness
bred in security: luxury is deadlier<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> than the sword, and the conquered
world is being avenged in the ruin of its conqueror. Perhaps
no symptom on which he enlarges is more significant and sinister
from his own point of view than that betrayed in a passing reference
by the verbal contrast<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> between <i>paganus</i> and <i>miles</i>. The peasant is no
longer soldier: and in this fact the weightiest movements of some 250
years of Roman history are virtually implied.</p>

<p>So much for an appeal to the Roman past. But Juvenal, like
Vergil before him, was not content with this. He looks back to the
primitive age<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> of man’s appearance on earth and idealizes the state
of things in this picture also. Mankind, rude healthy and chaste, had
not yet reached the notion of private property: therefore theft was
unknown. The moral is not pressed in the passage where this description
occurs; but it is worth noting because the greed of men in
imperial Rome, and particularly in the form of land-grabbing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
villa-building, is a favourite topic in the satires. All this side of contemporary
life, viewed as the fruit of artificial appetites and unnecessary
passions, is evidence of a degeneracy that has been going on ever
since the beginnings of society. And the worst of it is that those who
thrive on present conditions are the corrupt the servile and the mean,
from whom no improvement can be hoped for. Juvenal’s picture of
present facts as he sees them is quite enough to justify his pessimism.
As a means of arresting degeneration he is only able to suggest a
change<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> of mind, in fact to urge people to be other than they are.
But he cannot shew where the initiative is to be found. Certainly not
in the mongrel free populace of Rome, a rabble of parasites and
beggars. Nor in the ranks of the wealthy freedmen into whose hands
the chief opportunities of enrichment have passed, thanks to the imperial
jealousy of genuine Romans and preference of supple aliens.
These freedmen are the typical capitalists: they buy up everything,
land included; and Romans who despise these upstarts have nevertheless
to fawn on them. Nor again are leaders to be found in the surviving
remnant of old families. It is a sad pity, but pride of birth,
while indisposing them to useful industry, does not prevent them from
debauchery or from degrading themselves in public. Financial ruin
and charges of high treason are destroying them: even were this not
so, who would look to such persons for a wholesome example? Neither
religion with its formalities and excitements, nor philosophy with its
professors belying their moral preaching, could furnish the means of
effecting the change of heart needed for vital reform.</p>

<p>No, it was not from the imperial capital, the reeking hotbed of
wickedness, that any good could come. And when Juvenal turns to
the country it is remarkable how little comfort he seems to find in the
rural conditions of Italy. Like other writers, he refers to the immense
estates<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> that extended over a great part of the country, both arable
and grazing lands (<i>saltus</i>), the latter in particular being of monstrous
size. We cannot get from him any hint that the land-monopoly, the
canker of the later Republic, had been effectually checked. Nor indeed
had it. One of the ways in which rich patrons<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> rewarded clients for
services, honourable or (as he suggests) often dishonourable, was to
give the dependant a small landed estate. The practice was not new.
Maecenas had given Horace his Sabine farm. But the man who gave
away acres must have had plenty of acres to give. True, some of the
great landlords had earned<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> their estates by success in an honourable
profession: but the satirist is naturally more impressed by the cases of
those, generally freedmen, whose possessions are the fruit of corrupt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
compliance or ignoble trades. These upstarts, like the Trimalchio of
Petronius, live to display their wealth, and the acquisition of lands<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a>
and erection of costly villas are a means to this end. The fashion set
by them is followed by others, and over-buying and over-building are
the cause of bankruptcies. Two passages<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> indicate the continued existence
of an atrocious evil notorious in the earlier period of the <i>latifundia</i>,
the practice of compelling small holders to part with their
land by various outrages. The live stock belonging to a rich neighbour
are driven on to the poor man’s farm until the damage thus caused to
his crops forces him to sell—of course at the aggressor’s price. A
simpler form, ejectment without pretence of purchase, is mentioned as
an instance of the difficulties in the way of getting legal redress, at
least for civilians. There would be little point in mentioning such
wrongs as conceivable possibilities: surely they must have occurred
now and then in real life. The truth, I take it, was that the great landlord
owning a host of slaves had always at disposal a force well able
to carry out his territorial ambitions; and possession of power was a
temptation to use it. The employment of slaves in rural border-raids
was no new thing, and the slave, having himself nothing to lose, probably
found zest in a change of occupation.</p>

<p>In Juvenal agriculture appears as carried on by slave labour, and
the employment of supplementary wage-earners is ignored; not unnaturally,
for it was not necessary to refer to it. The satirist himself<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>
has rustic slaves, and is proud that they are rustic, when they on a
special occasion come in to wait at his table in Rome. Slaves are of
course included<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> in the stock of an estate, great or small, given or sold.
All this is commonplace: what is more to the satirist’s purpose is the
mention<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> of a member of an illustrious old family who has come down
in the world so low as to tend another man’s flocks for hire. And this
is brought in as a contrast to the purse-proud insolence of a wealthy
freedman. But more remarkable is the absence of any reference to
tenant <i>coloni</i>. Even the word <i>colonus</i> does not occur in any shade of
meaning. This too may fairly be accounted for by the fact that little
could have been got out of references to the system for the purposes
of his argument. It was, as he knew, small peasant landowners, not
tenants, that had been the backbone of old Rome; and it was this
class, viewed with the sympathetic eye of one sighing for perished
glories, that he would have liked to restore. It is a satirist’s bent to
wish for the unattainable and protest against the inevitable. For himself,
he can sing the praises of rustic simplicity and cheapness and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
denounce the luxury and extravagance of Roman society, though he
dare not assail living individuals. And in exposing the rottenness of
the civilization around him he attacks the very vices that had grown
to such portentous heights through the development of slavery. Idleness
bore its fruit, not only in the debauchery and gambling that
fostered unholy greed and crimes committed to procure the money
that was ever vanishing, but in the degradation of honest labour.
Pampered menials were arrogant, poor citizens servile. And vast tracts
of Italian land bore witness to the mournful fact that the land system,
so far from affording a sound basis for social and economic betterment,
was itself one of the worst elements of the situation.</p>

<p>At this stage it is well to recall the relation between agriculture
and military service, the farmer-soldier ideal. The long-since existing
tendency for the soldier to become a professional, while the free farmer
class was decaying, had never obliterated the impression of this ideal
on Roman minds. The belief that gymnastic exercises on Greek models
were no effective substitute for regular manual labour in the open air
as guarantees of military ‘fitness’ is still strong in Juvenal. It shews
itself in his pictures of life in Rome, where such exercises were practised
for the purpose of ‘keeping fit’ and ‘getting an appetite,’ much
as they are now. Followed by baths and massage and luxurious appliances
of every kind, this treatment enabled the jaded city-dweller
to minimize the enervating effects of idleness relieved by excitements
and debauchery. He significantly lays stress on the fact that these
habits were as common among women as among men. The usual allowance
must be made for a satirist’s exaggeration; but the general
truth of the picture is not to be doubted. The city life was no preparation
for the camp with its rough appliances and ever-present need
for the readiness to endure cheerfully the hardships of the field. The
toughness of the farm-labourer was proverbial: the Latin word <i>durus</i>
is his conventional epithet. In other words, he was a model of healthy
hardness and vigour. Now to Juvenal, as to others, the best object of
desire<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> was <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>, and he well knew that to secure
the second gave the best hope of securing the first. We might then
expect him to recommend field work as the surest way to get and
keep vigorous health. Yet I cannot find any indication of this precept
save the advice to a friend to get out of Rome and settle on a garden-plot
in the country. He says ‘there live devoted<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> to your clod-pick;
be the <i>vilicus</i> of a well-tended garden.’ I presume he means ‘be your
own steward, and lend a hand in tillage as a steward would do.’ But
an average <i>vilicus</i> would be more concerned to get work out of his
underlings than to exert himself, and Juvenal is not very explicit in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
his advice, the main point being to get his friend out of Rome. I have
reserved for comparison with this passage one from Martial<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>. In a
couplet on a pair of <i>halteres</i> (something rather like dumb-bells) he says
‘Why waste the strength of arms by use of silly dumb-bells? If a man
wants exercise, he had better go and dig in a vineyard.’ This is much
plainer, but one may doubt whether it is seriously meant to be an
ordinary rule of life. Probably it is no more than a sneer at gymnastic
exercises. For Martial well knew that muscle developed by the practice
of athletics<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> is very different from the bodily firmness and capacity for
continuous effort under varying conditions that is produced by a life
of hard manual labour. And the impression left on a reader’s mind
by epigrammatist and satirist alike is that in Rome and in the most
favoured and accessible parts of Italy the blessing of ‘corporal soundness’
was tending to become a monopoly of slaves. For when Juvenal
declares<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> that nowadays the rough <i>fossor</i>, though shackled with a
heavy chain, turns up his nose at the garden-stuff that fed a Manius
Curius in the olden days, hankering after the savoury fleshpots of the
cook-shop, we need not take him too seriously.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLIII">XLIII. PLINY THE YOUNGER.</h3>

<p>The <b>younger Pliny</b>, one of the generation who remembered Vespasian,
lived through the dark later years of Domitian, and rejoiced
in the better times of Nerva and Trajan, is one of our most important
witnesses. Not being a technical writer on agriculture, it was not his
business to dwell on what ought to be done rather than what was being
done. Being himself a great landowner as well as a man of wide interests
and high reputation, he knew the problems of contemporary
land-management from experience, and speaks with intelligence and
authority. He was not a man of robust constitution, and like many
others he found much refreshment in rural sojournings. He is remarkable
for keen appreciation of beautiful scenery. Adopted by his
uncle, the author of the <i>Natural History</i>, well-educated and in touch
with the literary circles and the best social life of Rome, his letters
illustrate the intellectual and moral influences that prevailed in cultivated
households of honest gentlemen. In particular he is to us perhaps
the very best example of the humanizing tendency of the current
philosophies of the day in relation to the subject of slavery. He is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
deeply interested in promoting manumissions<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> whenever he gets a chance.
His tender concern for the welfare of his slaves constantly meets us,
and he is only consoled for the death of one by reflecting that the man
was manumitted in time<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> and so died free. In fact he does not regard
slavery as a normally lifelong condition; and he allows his slaves to
make informal wills and respects their disposition of their savings
among their fellows<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> in the household, which is to slaves a sort of
commonwealth. Masters who don’t feel the loss of their slaves are
really not human. But this all refers to domestics, and does not touch
the case of the field-hand toiling on the farm.</p>

<p>A transaction<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> in reference to the sale of some land by the lake of
Como, Pliny’s own neighbourhood, illustrates the normal changes of
ownership that were going on, and his own generous nature. An old
lady, an intimate friend of his mother, wanted to have a property in
that lovely district. Pliny gave her the offer of any of his land at her
own price, reserving only certain parcels for sentimental reasons. Before
(as it seems) any bargain was made, a friend died and left ⁵⁄₁₂ of
his estate to Pliny, including some land such as the old lady desired.
Pliny at once sent his freedman Hermes to offer her the suitable
parcels for sale. She promptly clinched the bargain with Hermes
at a figure which turned out to be only ⁷⁄₉ of the full value. Pliny’s
attention was called to this, but he stood by the act of his freedman
and ratified the sale. The <i>publicani</i> who were then farming the 5%
duty on successions soon appeared, and claimed the 5% as reckoned
on estimated full value of the property. The old lady settled with
them on these terms, and then insisted on paying to Pliny the full
value, not the bargained price; which offer he, not to be outdone,
gracefully declined. Such was the course of a commonplace transaction,
carried out by exceptional people in an unselfish spirit. We are most
certainly not to suppose that this sort of thing was common in land-dealings.
Another letter<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> shews us how a well-meant benefaction
might fail in its aim for want of means in the beneficiary. An old
slave-woman, once Pliny’s wet-nurse, had evidently been manumitted,
and he made her a present of a small farm (<i>agellum</i>) to provide her
maintenance. At that time its market value was ample to secure this.
But things went wrong. For some reason the yearly returns fell, and
the market value fell also. Whether the old woman had tried to
manage it herself and failed, or whether a bad tenant had let down the
cultivation, does not plainly appear. At any rate Pliny was greatly
relieved when a friend, presumably one living near the place, undertook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
to direct the cultivation of the farm. He expresses his confidence
that under the new management the holding would recover its value.
For his own credit, not less than for the advantage of his nurse, he
wishes to see it produce its utmost. These little holdings no doubt
needed very skilful management, and I suspect that idle slaves were
in this case the cause of the trouble. Slaves commonly went with land,
and I do not think the generous donor would give his old nurse the
bare land without the needful labour. The old ‘Mammy’ could not
control them, and Pliny’s friend saved the situation.</p>

<p>Trajan’s order, requiring Provincial candidates for office to invest
a third<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> of their property in Italian real estate, and the artificial rise
of prices for the time, has been dealt with above. Pliny advised a
friend, if he would be not sorry<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> to part with his Italian estates, to
sell now at the top of the market and buy land in the Provinces,
where prices would be correspondingly lowered. Of the risks attendant
on landowning in Italy he was well aware, and one letter<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> on the pros
and cons of a tempting purchase must be translated in full. He writes
thus to a friend.</p>

<p>‘I am doing as usual, asking your advice on a matter of business.
There are now for sale some landed properties that border on farms
of mine and indeed run into them. There are about them many points
that tempt me, but some equally important that repel me. The temptations
are these. First, to round off my estate would be in itself an
improvement. Secondly, it would be a pleasure, and a real economy
to boot, to make one trip and one expense serve for a visit to both
properties, to keep both under the same<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> legal agent, indeed almost
under the same stewards, and to use only one of the granges as my
furnished house, just keeping the other in repair. I am taking into
account the cost of furniture, of chief servants, fancy gardeners, artisans,
and even hunting<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> outfit: for it makes a vast difference whether items
like these are concentrated in one spot or are scattered in separate
places. On the other hand I fear it may be rash to expose so large a
property to the same local climatic risks. It seems safer to encounter
the changes of fortune by not holding too much land in one neighbourhood.
Moreover, it is a very pleasant thing to have change of
scene and climate, and so too is the mere touring about from one of
your estates to another. Then comes the chief issue on which I am
trying to make up my mind. The farms are productive, the soil rich,
the water-supply good; they contain pastures, vineyards, and woodlands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
that afford timber, from which there is a small but regular return.
A favoured land, you see: but it is suffering from the weakness<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> of
those who farm it. For the late landlord several times distrained<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> on
the tenants’ goods, lessening their arrears<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> of rent for the moment,
but draining their substance for the future: the failure of this sent up
the arrears once more. So they will have to be equipped<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> with labour;
which will cost all the more because only trusty slaves will do. As
for chained slaves, I never keep them on my estates, and in those
parts nobody does. I have now only to tell you the probable price.
It is three million sesterces, though at one time it was five million:
but, what with the present scarcity<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> of tenants and the prevailing
agricultural depression, the returns from the farms have fallen, and so
has the market value. You will want to know whether I can raise
easily even the three millions. It is true that nearly all I have is invested<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a>
in land; still I have some money out at interest, and I shall
have no trouble in borrowing. I shall get it from my mother-in-law,
who lets me use her cash as if it were my own. So pray don’t let this
consideration influence you, provided the others do not gainsay my
project; I beg you to weigh them most carefully. For of experience
and foresight you have plenty and to spare as a guide in general
business, particularly in the placing of investments.’</p>

<p>The glimpses of agricultural conditions that we get from Pliny’s
letters do not as a rule give us a cheerful picture. Most of his land
seems to have been under vines, and the vintage<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> was often poor,
sometimes a failure. Drought and hailstorms played havoc<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> with the
crops. When there was a bountiful vintage, of course the wine made
a poor price. Hence the returns from the farms are small, and unsafe<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>
at that. So he replies to similar complaints of friends. When he is at
any of his country places he generally has to face a chorus of grumbling<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a>
tenants. He was sometimes utterly puzzled what to do. If inclined
to make abatements<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> of rent, he is uneasily aware that this remedy
may only put off the evil day. If tenants do not recover their solvency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
(and he knows that they seldom do), he will have to change his policy<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a>,
for they are ruining the land by bad husbandry. For himself, he is
no farmer. When on a country estate, watching the progress of the
vintage, he potters about<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> in a rather purposeless manner, glad to
retire to his study where he can listen to his reader or dictate to his
secretary: if he can produce<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> a few lines, that is his crop. It would
seem that not all his farms were let to tenants. In one letter he speaks
of his town-slaves<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> being employed as overseers or gangers of the
rustic hands, and remarks that one of his occupations is to pay surprise
visits to these fellows. We can guess what a drag upon Italian agriculture
the slavery-system really was: here is a man full of considerate
humanity, devoted to the wellbeing of his slaves, who cannot trust
one of them to see that others do their work.</p>

<p>But that letting to tenants was his usual plan is evident from the
number of his references to the trouble they gave him. It was not
always clear whether to get rid of them or to keep them (and if the
latter, on what terms,) offered the less disastrous solution of an awkward
problem. In one letter<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> he gives the following excuse for his
inability to be present in Rome on the occasion of a friend’s succeeding
to the consulship. ‘You won’t take it ill of me, particularly as I am
compelled<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> to see to the letting of some farms, a business that means
making an arrangement for several years, and will drive me to adopt
a fresh policy. For in the five years<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> just past the arrears have grown,
in spite of large abatements granted. Hence most (of the tenants)
take no further trouble to reduce their liabilities, having lost hope of
ever meeting them in full: they grab and use up everything that
grows, reckoning that henceforth it is not they<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> who would profit by
economy. So as the evils increase I must find remedies to meet them.
And the only possible plan is to let these farms<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> not at a cash rent
but on shares, and then to employ some of my staff as task-masters
to watch the crops. Besides, there is no fairer source of income than
the returns rendered by soil climate and season. True, this plan requires
mighty honesty, keen eyes, and a host of hands. Still I must
make the trial; I must act as in a chronic malady, and use every
possible treatment to promote a change.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>No doubt there were many landlords more effectively qualified to
wring an income out of rustic estates than this delicate and gentle
literary man. Indeed he knew this himself and made no secret of it.
Writing to a friend<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> he says ‘When others go to visit their estates, it
is to come back the richer; when I do so, it is to come back the poorer
for the trip.’ He then tells the story of a recent experience. He had
disposed of the year’s vintage on some estate (evidently the hanging
crop) by auction to some speculative buyers, who were tempted by
the apparent prospects of a rise in price to follow. Things did not
turn out as expected, and Pliny felt bound to make some abatement
in the covenanted price. Whether this was simply owing to his own
scrupulous love of fair dealing, or whether some stipulation in the
contract of sale had automatically become operative, does not seem
quite clear: I should give him the benefit of the doubt. How to
make the abatement equitably, so as to treat each case with perfect
fairness, was a difficult problem. For, as he shews at length, the circumstances
of different cases differed widely, and a mere ‘flat rate’
remission of so much per cent all round would not have worked out
so as to give equal relief to all. After careful calculation he devised a
scheme that satisfied his conscientious wish to act fairly by each and
all. Of course this left him a large sum out of pocket, but he thought
that the general approval of the neighbourhood and the gratitude of
the relieved speculators were well worth the money. For to have a
good name among the local dealers was good business for the future.
Many an honest gentleman since Pliny’s time has similarly consoled
himself for his losses of honour, and some of them have not missed
their well-earned recompense.</p>

<p>Among his many country properties, a certain Tuscan <i>villa</i> was
one of his favourite resorts. In a long description of it and its various
attractions he mentions<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> incidentally that the Tiber, which ran right
through the estate, was available for barges in winter and spring, and
thus enabled them to send their farm-produce by water-carriage to
Rome. This confirms the evidence of other writers, as does also the
letter describing the widespread devastation<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> caused by a Tiber flood.
More notable as throwing light on conditions of life in rural Italy is a
letter<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> in reply to a correspondent who had written to inform him of
the disappearance of a Roman of position and property when on a
journey, apparently in the Tiber country. The man was known to
have reached Ocriculum, but after that all trace of him was lost. Pliny
had small hopes from the inquiry that it was proposed to conduct. He
cites a similar case from his own acquaintance years before. A fellow-burgess
of Comum had got military promotion as centurion through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
the influence of Pliny, who made him a present of money when he set
out, apparently for Rome, to take up his office. Nothing more was
ever heard of him. But Pliny adds that in this case, as in the one just
reported, the slaves escorting their master also disappeared. Therefore
he leaves it an open question, whether<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> the slaves murdered their
master and escaped undetected, or whether the whole party on either
occasion were murdered by a robber band. The lack of a regular constabulary
in Italy had been, and still was, a grave defect in Roman
administration. To account for this neglect we must remember that
rich men always relied on their slave-escort for protection. If the poor
man travelled, he was not worth<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> robbing; his danger was the chance
of being kidnapped and sold for a slave, and we have seen that some
of the early emperors tried to put down this abuse. The danger to a
traveller from his own slaves was perhaps greater on a journey than
at home; but it was of the same kind, inseparable from slavery, and
was most cruelly dealt with by the law. Meanwhile brigandage seems
never to have been thoroughly extinguished in Italy or the Provinces<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>.</p>

<p>In spite of these drawbacks to life and movement in a great slave-holding
community, there is nothing that strikes a reader more in
Pliny’s letters than the easy acceptance of present conditions. Under
Trajan the empire seemed so secure and strong, that unpleasant occurrences
could be regarded as only of local importance. That the
free population of Italy could no longer defend in arms what their
forefathers had won, was manifest. But custom was making it seem
natural to rely on armies raised in the Provinces; all the more so perhaps
as emperors were being supplied by Spain. That slavery itself
was one of the cankers that were eating out the vitality of the Roman
empire, does not seem to have occurred to Pliny or other writers of
the day. Philosophers had got so far as to protest against its worst
abuses and vindicate the claims of a common humanity. Christian
apostles, in the circles reached by them, preached also obedience<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> and
an honesty above eye-service as the virtues of a slave. But in both of
these contrasted doctrines the teachers were mainly if not exclusively
thinking of domestics, not of farm-hands. There was however one
imperial department in which the distinction between slave and free
still rigidly followed old traditional rules; and it was one much more
likely to have to deal with cases of rustic slaves than of domestics.
This was the army. The immemorial rule, that no slave could be a
soldier, had never been broken save under the pressure of a few great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
temporary emergencies, or by the evasions incident to occasions of
civil warfare. It still remained in force. When Pliny was governor of
the Province of Bithynia and Pontus he had to deal with a question
arising out of this rule. Recruiting was in progress, and two slaves
were discovered among the men enlisted. They had already taken the
military oath, but were not yet embodied in any corps. Pliny reported
the case<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> to Trajan, and asked for instructions. The emperor sent a
careful answer. ‘If they were called up (<i>lecti</i>), then the recruiting
officer did wrong: if they were furnished as substitutes<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> (<i>vicarii dati</i>),
the fault is with those who sent them: but if they presented themselves
as volunteers, well knowing<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> their disqualification, they must be
punished. That they are not as yet embodied, matters little. For they
were bound to have given a true account of their extraction on the
day when they came up for inspection.’ What came of it we do not
know. But it is no rash guess that the prospect of escaping into
the ranks of the army would be attractive<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> to a sturdy rustic slave,
and that a recruiting officer might ask few questions when he saw a
chance of getting exceptionally fine recruits. Probably the two detected
suffered the capital penalty. Such was still the rigid attitude of
the great soldier-emperor, determined not to confess the overstraining
of the empire’s man-power. But the time was not far distant when
Marcus, beset by the great pestilence and at his wits’ end for an army
of defence, would enrol slaves<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> and ruffians of any kind to fight for
Rome.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to cite the numerous references in the letters to
slaves and slavery that are not connected with agriculture. Nor need
I pursue in detail the circumstances of one of his generous public
benefactions, the alimentary endowment<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> for freeborn children, probably
at Comum. It has been mentioned in another chapter, and its
chief point of interest is in the elaborate machinery employed to secure
the perpetuity of the charity. To leave money to the municipality was
to risk its being squandered. To leave them land meant that the
estate would not be carefully managed. What he did was to convey<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a>
the property in some land to a representative of the burgesses, and to
take it back subject to a rent-charge considerably less than the yearly
value of the land. Thus the endowment was safe, for the margin allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
would ensure that the land would not be allowed to drop out of
cultivation. An interesting glimpse of municipal patriotism, active and
passive. The only other detail I have to note is that he regularly uses
the term <i>colonus</i> as ‘tenant-farmer.’ I have not found a single instance
of the older sense ‘tiller of the soil.’ We cannot argue from Pliny to
his contemporaries without some reserve, for he was undoubtedly an
exceptional man. But, so far as his evidence goes, it bears out the
view that great landlords were giving up the system of slave stewardships
for free tenancies. Owners there still were who kept their
estates in hand, farming themselves or by deputy for their own account.
But that some of these were men of a humbler class, freedmen
to wit, we have seen reason to believe from references in the elder
Pliny. Perhaps they were many, and some may even have worked
with their own hands. Be this as it may, slave labour<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> was still the
staple appliance of agriculture, and whenever there were slaves for sale
there were always buyers.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLIV">XLIV. SUETONIUS AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p><b>Suetonius</b>, whose Lives of the first twelve emperors contain much
interesting and important matter, stands in relation to the present
inquiry on the same footing as most of the regular historians. He
flourished in the times of Trajan and Hadrian, and therefore what
remains of his writings is not contemporary evidence. But he was a
student and a careful compiler from numerous works now lost. The
number of passages in which he refers to matters directly or indirectly
bearing on rustic life and labour is not large, and most of them have
been cited in other chapters, where they find a place in connexion
with the context. He can be dealt with very briefly here.</p>

<p>The close connexion between wars and the supply of slaves is
marked in the doings of Julius<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> Caesar. Gaulish and British captives
were (as Caesar himself records) no small part of the booty won in his
northern campaigns. He rewarded his men after a victory with a
prisoner apiece: these would soon be sold to the dealers who followed
the army, and most of them would find their way to the Roman slave-market.
To gratify friendly princes or provincial communities, he
sent them large bodies of slaves as presents. So his victims served
instead of cash to win adherents for their new master. And these
natives of the North would certainly be used for heavy rough work,
mostly as farm-hands. When Augustus, loth to enlarge the empire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
felt constrained to teach restless tribes a lesson, he imposed a reserve-condition<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>
on the sale of prisoners taken: they were not to be employed
in districts near their old homes, and not to be manumitted
before thirty years. Most of these would probably also be brought to
Italy for the same kind of service. Yet, as we have seen, there was
kidnapping<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> of freemen in Italy; probably a sign that slaves were
already become dear. That their numbers had been reduced in the
civil wars, not only by death but by manumission, is fairly certain. In
the war with Sextus Pompeius it was found necessary<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> to manumit
20,000 slaves to serve as oarsmen in the fleet. Suetonius also records
that Augustus when emperor had trouble with the unwillingness of
Romans to be called up for military duty. He had to deal sharply<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a>
with an <i>eques</i> who cut off the thumbs of his two sons to incapacitate
them. The abuse of the public corn-doles was a grave evil. Men got
rid of the burden of maintaining old slaves by manumitting them and
so making them, as freedmen-citizens, entitled to a share of the doles.
This was shifting the burden of feeding useless mouths on to the
state. Augustus saw that the vast importation of corn for this bounty
tended to discourage<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> Italian agriculture, and thought of abolishing
the whole system of <i>frumentationes</i>. But he had to give up the project,
being convinced that the system would be restored. He really desired
to revive agriculture, and it was surely with this aim that he advanced
capital sums<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> to landlords free of interest on good security for the
principal. The growth of humane sentiment toward slaves is marked
by the ordinance of Claudius<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> against some very cruel practices of
slaveowners. And we are reminded that penal servitude was now a
regular institution in the Roman empire by Nero’s order<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> for bringing
prisoners from all parts to carry out some colossal works in Italy, and
for fixing condemnation to hard labour as the normal penalty of crime.</p>

<p>In the Lives of the three Flavian emperors there are one or two
passages of interest. At this distance of time it is not easy to appreciate
the effect on the sentiments of Roman society of the extinction
of the Julio-Claudian house, and the accession of a thoroughly plebeian
one, resting on the support of the army and readily accepted by the
Provinces. Suetonius, like Tacitus, was near enough to the revolutionary
year 69 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> to understand the momentous nature of the crises
that brought Vespasian to the head of affairs. He takes pains to
describe<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> the descent of the new emperor from a Sabine family of no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
remarkable distinction. For two generations they had combined with
fair success the common Roman professions of military service and
finance. They were respectable people of good local standing. But
there was another story relative to a generation further back. It was
said that Vespasian’s greatgrandfather (this takes us back to Republican
days) had been a contractor<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> for rustic labour. He was a
headman or ‘boss’ of working-parties such as are wont to pass year
after year from Umbria into the Sabine country to serve as farm-labourers.
Of this story Suetonius could not discover any confirmation.
But that there had been, and perhaps still was, some such supply
of migratory labour available, is a piece of evidence not to be ignored.
Vespasian himself was a soldier who steadily rose in the usual official
career till he reached the coveted post of governor of Africa. After a
term of honest but undistinguished rule, he came back no richer than
he went, indeed he was very nearly bankrupt. He was driven to mortgage
all his landed estate, and to become for a time a slave-dealer<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>,
in order to live in the style that his official rank required. The implied
disgrace of resorting to a gainful but socially despised trade is at
least evidence of the continual demand for human chattels. Of two
acts of Domitian<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a>, his futile ordinance to check vine-growing, and his
grant of the remaining odd remnants of Italian land to present occupants,
enough has been said above.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to collect the numerous passages in writers of
this period that illustrate the growing change of view as to slavery in
general. The point made by moralists, that moral bondage is more
degrading than physical (for the latter need not be really degrading),
came with not less force from Epictetus the slave than from Seneca
the noble Roman. It is however worth while just to note the frequent
references to cases of philosophers and other distinguished literary
men who had either actually been slaves or had at some time in their
lives been forced to earn their daily bread by bodily labour. Such
cases are, Cleanthes<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> drawing water for wages, Plautus<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a>
    hired by the
baker to grind at his mill, and Protagoras<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> earning his living as a
common porter. In one passage several slaves<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> are enumerated who
became philosophers. Now, what is the significance of these and other
references of the same import? I suggest that they have just the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
bearing as the general principles of common humanity argumentatively
pressed by the Stoic and other schools of thought. The sermonizing
of Seneca is a good specimen. But discussion of principles
in the abstract was never the strong point of Roman society, and citation
of concrete instances would serve to give reality to views that
were only too often regarded as the visionary speculations of chattering
Greeks. That Roman authors, down to the last age of Roman
literature, expressed the longing for a more wholesome state of agriculture
by everlasting references to Cincinnatus and the rest of the
traditional rustic heroes, is another recognition of this method. The
notion that courage and contempt of death could be fostered by the
spectacle of gladiators rested on much the same basis. True, there is
nothing in the above considerations that directly bears upon rustic
labour as such: but hints that ‘a man’s a man for a’ that’ are not to
be ignored when they make their appearance in the midst of a slave-holding
society.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLV">XLV. APULEIUS.</h3>

<p>The Province of Africa was in this period a flourishing part of the
empire, giving signs of its coming importance in the next generation,
when it produced several emperors. It was in fact a sort of successor
of Spain, and like Spain it enjoyed the advantage of not fronting on
the usual seats of war to the North and East. One of the most remarkable
literary figures of the age was the African<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> <b>L Apuleius</b> of
Madaura, who travelled widely as student and lecturer, and was well
acquainted with Greece and Italy. A philosopher of the mystical-Platonist
type, he was in touch with practical life through his study of
the Law, and was for some time a pleader in Rome. His native Province<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a>
was notoriously addicted to litigation, and a modern scholar<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a>
has shewn that the works of Apuleius abound in legal phraseology
and are coloured with juristic notions. Now, it was not possible to
go far in considering property and rights without coming upon
questions relative to land: moreover, he himself owned land in Africa.
Accordingly we find in him some references to land, and even to
rustic labour and conditions of rural life. And, though his <i>Metamorphoses</i>
is a fantastic romance, there is no reason to doubt that incidents
and scenes (other than supernatural) are true to facts observed by the
writer, and therefore admissible as evidence of a general kind. An<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
instance may be found in the case of the ass, that is the hero of the
story transformed into that shape by magic. He is to be sold, and the
waggish auctioneer<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> says to a possible bidder ‘I am well aware that it
is a criminal offence to sell you a Roman citizen for a slave: but why
not buy a good and trusty slave that will serve you as a helper both
at home and abroad?’ Here we have a recognition of the fact of kidnapping,
which is referred to elsewhere in the book; that in cases of
Roman victims the law took a very serious view of the offence; while
the point of the pleasantry lies in the circumstance that neither
auctioneer nor company present are aware that the ass is a transformed
man, liable to regain his human shape by magical disenchantment.</p>

<p>The scene of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> is laid in Greece, and the anecdotes
included in it do not give us a favourable picture of that part of the
Roman empire. There was surely nothing to tempt the writer to
misrepresent the condition of the country by packing his descriptions
with unreal details: he would thus have weakened the effect of his
romance. Wealth in the hands of a few, surrounded by a pauper
majority; shrunken towns, each with its more or less degraded rabble;
general insecurity for life liberty and property; a cruel and arbitrary
use of power; a spiritless acquiescence in this pitiful state of things,
relieved by the excitements of superstition and obscenity: such was
Roman Greece as Apuleius saw it. No doubt there was Roman Law
to enforce honesty and order. But the administration of justice seldom,
if ever, reaches the standard of legislation; and as yet the tendency of
the Roman government was to interfere as little as possible with local
authorities. Greece in particular had always been treated with special
indulgence, in recognition of her glorious past. Whether the effects
of this favour were conducive to the wellbeing of the country, may
fairly be doubted. The insane vanity of Nero, masquerading as
Liberator of Greece, had surely done more harm than good. Hadrian’s
benefactions to Athens, dictated by sentimental antiquarianism, could
not improve the general condition of the country, however satisfactory
they might be to what was now an University town living on students
and tourists.</p>

<p>One of the first things that strikes a reader of this book is the
matter-of-fact way in which brigandage<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> is taken for granted. These
robbers work in organized bands under chosen captains, have regular
strongholds as bases of operations, draw recruits from the poverty-stricken
peasantry or slaves, and do not hesitate to attack and plunder
great mansions, relying on the cowardice or indifference (or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
treachery) of the rich owner’s slaves. Murder is to them a mere trifle,
and their ingenuity in torturing is fiendish. No doubt their activities
are somewhat exaggerated as a convenient part of the machinery of
the story, but the lament of Plutarch and the Euboic idyll of Dion
forbid us to regard these brigand-scenes as pure fiction. They are
another side of the same picture of distressful Greece. Nor is the
impression produced thereby at all weakened by a specimen of military<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a>
insolence. Greece was not a Province in which a large army was kept,
but all Governors had some armed force to support their authority.
The story introduces the ass with his present owner, a gardener, on
his back. They are met by a swaggering bully of a soldier, who inquires
where they are going. He asks this in Latin. The gardener
makes no reply, not knowing Latin. The angry soldier knocks him
off the ass, and repeats his question in Greek. On being told that
they are on their way to the nearest town, he seizes the ass on the
pretext of being wanted for fatigue duty in the service of the Governor,
and will listen to no entreaties. Just as he is preparing to break the
gardener’s skull, the gardener trips him up and pounds him to some
purpose. He shams dead, while the gardener hurries off and takes
refuge with a friend in the town. The soldier follows, and stirs up his
mates, who induce the local magistrates to take up the matter and
give them satisfaction. The gardener’s retreat is betrayed by a neighbour,
and clever concealment nullified by an indiscretion of the ass.
The wretched gardener is found and haled off to prison awaiting
execution, while the soldier takes possession of the ass. This story
again is surely not grotesque and incredible fiction. More likely it is
made up from details heard by the African during his sojourn in
Greece. If scenes of this kind were possible, the outlook of humble
rustics<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> can hardly have been a cheerful one.</p>

<p>That perils of robbers and military insolence were not the only
troubles of the countryside, is shewn by the following anecdote<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> describing
the brutal encroachments of a big landlord on poorer neighbours.
A landowner, apparently a man of moderate means, had three sons,
well-educated and well-behaved youths, who were close friends of a
poor man with a little cottage of his own. Bordering on this man’s
little holding was the large and fertile landed estate belonging to a
rich and powerful neighbour in the prime of life. This rich man,
turning the fame of his ancestors to bad account, strong in the support<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
of party cliques, in fact an autocrat<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> within the jurisdiction of the
town, was given to making raids on the poverty of his humble neighbour.
He slaughtered his flocks, drove off his oxen, and trampled
down his crops before they were ripe, till he had robbed him of all the
fruit of his thrift. His next desire was to expel him altogether from
his patch of soil: so he got up a baseless dispute over boundaries, and
claimed the whole of the land as his own. The poor man, though
diffident by nature, was bent upon keeping his hereditary ground if
only for his own burial. The claim upset him greatly, and he entreated
a number of his friends to attend at the settlement<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> of boundaries.
Among those present were the three brothers mentioned above, who
came to do their little best in the cause of their injured friend. But
the rich man, unabashed by the presence of a number of citizens,
treated all efforts at conciliation with open contempt, and swore that
he would order his slaves to pick the poor man up by the ears and
chuck him ever so far from his cottage in less than no time. The bystanders
were greatly incensed at this brutal utterance. One of the
three brothers dared to say ‘It’s no good your bullying and threatening
like this just because you are a man of influence; don’t forget that
even poor<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> men have found in the laws guarding freemen’s rights a
protector against the outrages of the rich.’ Upon this the enraged
tyrant let loose his ferocious dogs<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> and set them on the company. A
horrible scene followed. One of the three youths was torn to pieces,
and the others also perished; one of them slain by the rich man himself,
the other, after avenging his brother, by his own hand.</p>

<p>The mere aggression of the rich landlord on the poor is interesting
as adding another instance of the encroachments to the occurrence
of which many other writers testify. The most remarkable feature
of the story is the insolent disregard of the Law shewn by the rich
man from first to last. That the governor of the Province could prevent
or punish such outrages, if his attention were called to them, is
not to be doubted. But he could not be everywhere at once, and it is
not likely that many of the poorer class would be forward to report
such doings and appear as accusers of influential persons. The rich
probably sympathized with their own class, and a poor man shrank
from a criminal prosecution that would in any event expose him to
their vengeance afterwards. True, the poor were the majority. But it
was a very old principle of Roman policy to entrust the effective control
of municipalities to the burgesses of property, men who had
something to lose and who, being a minority, would earn their local<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
supremacy by a self-interested obedience to the central government.
Thus local magnates (their evil day was not yet come) were left very
much to their own devices, and most provincial governors cared too
much for their own ease and comfort to display an inquisitive zeal.
Moreover, so far as the rich thought it judicious to keep the poorer
contented, it would be the town rabble that profited chiefly if not
exclusively by their liberalities: the more isolated rustic was more
liable to suffer from their land-proud greediness. We must picture
them as overbearing and arbitrary slaveholders, practically uncontrolled;
and the worst specimens among them as an ever-present
terror to a cowed and indigent peasantry. We are not to suppose
that things were as bad as this in all parts of Greece, but that there
was little or nothing to prevent their becoming so, even in happier
districts.</p>

<p>From time immemorial the Greek tendency had been to congregate
in towns, and after the early fall of the landowning aristocracies this
tendency was strengthened by democratic movements. The country
as a whole was never able to feed its population. But the population
was now greatly reduced. Given due security, perhaps the rustics
might now have been able to feed the towns. And that they were to
some extent doing so may be inferred from the fact that the chief
peasant figure in the rural life of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> is the market-gardener<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>.
If he is but left in peace, he seems to be doing fairly well.
It is natural at this point to inquire whether a <i>hortulanus</i> might not
also be a <i>colonus</i>, the former name connoting his occupation and the
latter his legal position in relation to the land. Both terms often
occur, but they seem to be quite distinct: I can find nothing to justify
the application of both to the same person. And yet I cannot feel
certain that Apuleius always means a tenant-farmer<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> under a landlord
whenever he uses the word <i>colonus</i>. Probably he does, as Norden
seems to think. In any case the gardener is evidently in a smaller
way of business than the average <i>colonus</i>, and it may be that his little
scrap of land is his own. He certainly works<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> with his own hands, and
I find nothing to suggest that he is an employer of slaves, or that he
himself is not free. That the tenant-farmers were often <i>coloni partiarii</i>,
bound to deliver to their landlord a fixed share of their produce in
kind, is highly probable. But this does not exclude the payment of
money rents as well. Local usage probably varied in different districts.
It is true that Apuleius several times<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> uses <i>partiarius</i>
    metaphorically,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
but this only shews his addiction to legal language, and is no proof
of the prevalence of the share-system in Greece. The <i>coloni</i>, nominally
free, were as yet only bound to the soil by the practical difficulty of
clearing themselves from the obligations that encumbered them and
checked freedom of movement. But they were now near to the time
when they were made fixtures by law.</p>

<p>Another work of Apuleius furnishes matter of interest, the so-called
<i>Apologia</i>, a speech in his own defence when tried on a charge of
magical arts about the year 158 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. That the accused was in no little
danger from this criminal prosecution has been shewn<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> by Norden.
What concerns us is the reference to rustic affairs that the speaker is led
to make in the course of his argument, when demolishing some of the
allegations of his enemies. The trial was in Africa at the regular provincial
assize, and the conditions referred to are African. Apuleius,
as a man of note in his native Province, takes high ground to manifest
his confidence in the strength of his case. The prosecution want to
draw him into an unseemly squabble over side-issues. As the chief
alleged instance of his magic was connected with his marriage to a
rich lady, a widow of mature age, whom he was said to have bewitched,
being at the time a young man in need, it had evidently been thought
necessary to discuss his financial position as throwing light upon his
motives. If at the same time he could be represented as having acted
in defiance of well-known laws, so much the better. If we may trust
the bold refutation of Apuleius, they entangled themselves in a contradiction
and betrayed their own blind malice. His reply<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> is as
follows. ‘Whether you keep slaves to cultivate your farm, or whether
you have an arrangement with your neighbours for exchange<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> of
labour, I do not know and do not want to know. But you (profess
to) know that at Oea, on the same day, I manumitted three slaves:
this was one of the things you laid to my charge, and your counsel
brought it up against me, though a moment before he had said that
when I came to Oea I had with me but a single slave. Now, will you
have the goodness to explain how, having but one, I could manumit
three,—unless this too is an effect of magic. Was there ever such
monstrous lying, whether from blindness or force of habit? He says,
Apuleius brought one slave with him to Oea. Then, after babbling a
few words, he adds that Apuleius manumitted three in one day at
Oea. If he had said that I brought with me three, and granted freedom
to them all, even that would not have deserved<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> belief. But, suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
I had done so, what then? would not three freedmen be as sure a
mark of wealth as three slaves of indigence?’</p>

<p>After this outburst the speaker is at pains to point out that to do
with few slaves is a philosopher’s part, commended by examples not
of philosophers only but of men famed in Roman history. The well-worn
topic of the schools, that to need little is true riches, is set forth
at large, with instances in illustration. He then asserts<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> that he inherited
a considerable property from his father, which has been much
reduced by the cost of his journeys and expenses as a student and
gifts to deserving friends. After this he turns upon his adversary.
‘But you and the men of your uneducated rustic class are worth just
what your property is worth and no more, like trees that bear no fruit
and are worth only the value of the timber in their stems. Henceforth
you had better not taunt any man with his poverty. Your father left
you nothing but a tiny farm at Zarat, and it is but the other day that
you were taking the opportunity of a shower of rain to give it a good
ploughing with the help of a single ass, and made it a three-days<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> job.
What has kept you on your legs is the quite recent windfalls of inheritances
from kinsmen who died one after another.’ These personalities,
in the true vein of ancient advocacy, do not tell us much,
but it is interesting to note that the skilled pleader, a distinguished
man of the world, quite naturally sneers at his opponent for having
been a poor working farmer. Whether this was an especially effective
taunt in the Province Africa, the home of great estates, it is hardly
possible to guess.</p>

<p>Of small farmers in Africa, working their own land, we have, probably
by accident, hardly any other record. But the reference above,
to neighbours taking turns to help one another on their farms, comes
in so much as a matter of course that we may perhaps conclude that
there were such small free farmers, at least in some parts of the
Province. For slaves we need no special evidence. But the lady whom
Apuleius had married seems to have been a large slaveowner as well
as a large landowner. He declares that he with difficulty persuaded
her to quiet the claims of her sons by making over to them a great
part of her estate in land and other goods; and one item consists<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> of
400 slaves. We have also a reference to <i>ergastula</i> in a passage where
he is protesting that to charge him with practising magic arts with
the privity of fifteen slaves is on the face of it ridiculous<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>. ‘Why, 15<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
free men make a community, 15 slaves make a household, and 15
chained ones a lock-up.’ I take these <i>vincti</i> to be troublesome slaves,
not debtors. Again, in refuting the suggestion that he had bewitched
the lady, he states as proof of her sanity that at the very time when
she is said to have been out of her mind she most intelligently audited
and passed the accounts of her stewards<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> and other head-servants on
her estates. And in general it has been well said<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> that Apuleius, with
all his wide interest in all manner of things, did not feel driven to
inquire into the right or wrong of slavery in itself. He took it as he
found it in the Roman world of his day. That he had eyes to see some
of its most obvious horrors, may be inferred from the description<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> of
the condition of slaves in a flour-mill, put into the mouth of the man-ass.
But with the humanitarian movements of these times he shews
no sympathy; and he can depict abominable scenes of cruelty and
bestiality without any warmth of serious indignation.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLVI">XLVI. GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> brings us to the beginning
of a long period of troubles, in which the growing weakness of the
empire was exposed, the principate-system of Augustus finally failed
under the predominance of military power, and the imperial government
was left to be reorganized by Diocletian on a more Oriental
model. There is no doubt that during some hundred years the internal
wellbeing of the Roman empire was being lowered, and that the parts
most open to barbarian invasion suffered terribly. But the pressure of
taxation to supply military needs bore heavily on all parts and impaired
the vitality of the whole. Reactions there were now and then,
when a strong man, or even a well-meaning one, became emperor and
had a few years in which to combat present evils and for the moment
check them. But the average duration of reigns was very brief; emperors
were generally murdered or slain in battle; from 249 to 283
the chief function of an emperor was to lead his army against barbarian
invaders. It is a remarkable fact that the first half of this
unhappy century was the classical period of Roman jurisprudence.
The important post of Praetorian Prefect, which began with a dignified
military command and was more and more becoming the chief ministry
of the Empire, was again and again held by eminent jurists. But in
the long run the civil power could not stand against the jealousy of
the military, and the murder of Ulpian in 228 practically ends the
series of great lawyer-ministers, leaving the sword in undisputed control.
The authorities for this century of troubles are meagre and unsatisfactory.
With the help of contemporary inscriptions, modern
writers are able to compose some sort of a history of the times, so far
as public events and governmental activities are concerned. But the
literature of private life, the source of our best evidence on agricultural
labour, is for the time at an end, and the facts of farm life were not of
the kind thought worthy of record in inscriptions.</p>

<p>There is therefore nothing to be done but to glean the few scraps
of information that in any way bear upon the condition of tillers of
the soil in this period. They are as a rule of little value, and they come
from writers of little authority. But it is something if they are of a
piece with the general record of these unhappy times. Even the imperial
biographies of Marius Maximus survive only in the meagre
abstracts of later writers, and modern historians are quite unable to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
reconstruct any clear picture of the inner life of the period 180-284 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>
owing to the lack of materials.</p>

<p>The most significant piece of information relates to Pertinax. We
are told<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> that one of the useful reforms contemplated by him was the
reclamation of waste lands throughout the empire. He ordained that
any one might occupy derelict lands, even on the imperial estates: on
careful cultivation thereof, the farmer was to become owner<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a>. For a
space of ten years he was to be exempt from all taxation, and his
ownership was to be guaranteed against future disturbance. This passage
is good evidence of the decay of agriculture, agreeing with what
we have learnt from other sources. But we cannot gather from it that
the well-meant design had any practical effect. Pertinax was only
emperor for the inside of three months, and could not realize his virtuous
aspirations. About 80 years later we find Aurelian<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> planning the development
of waste lands in Etruria, and Probus<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> giving allotments in
the wilds of Isauria to his veterans as settlers with obligation of military
service. There can be little doubt that the depopulation and decline
of cultivation, made sadly manifest in the calamitous times of
Marcus Aurelius, had never ceased to undermine the vital forces of the
empire. How to fill up deserted lands, and make them productive of
food and revenue, was the problem that every serious ruler had to face.
And there was in fact only one resource available to meet the need.
The native population of the empire, stationary at best, had been further
reduced by pestilence and famine, and was not able to fill up the
spaces laid waste by frontier wars. Hence the policy of bringing in
masses of barbarians, adopted by Marcus, had to be repeated again
and again.</p>

<p>We must not confuse these settlements with the immigrations of
conquering tribes that occurred later. Rome was still superior to her
adversaries in military organization and skill, and under fairly equal
conditions able to defeat them in pitched battles. Thus Claudius II
gained great victories over the Goths, and the biographer<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> tells us of
the sequel. ‘The Roman provinces were filled with barbarian slaves
and Scythian tillers of the soil. The Goth was turned into a settler on
the barbarian frontier. There was not a single district but had some
Gothic slave whose bondage attested the triumph.’ Here we seem to
have the echo of a somewhat boastful contemporary version. The
mention of both slaves and frontier colonists is to be noted. We have
no statistics to guide us in an attempt to estimate the relative numbers
of the two classes. But the settlement of defeated barbarians on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
frontier as Roman subjects is clearly regarded as a worthy achievement.
So indeed it might have been, had it been possible to civilize
them as Romans, only profiting by the introduction of new blood. But
this process was no longer possible: its opposite, the barbarizing of
Roman lands, steadily went on. Claudius only reigned about two
years. The great soldier who followed him in 270-5, Aurelian, had a
plan for employing prisoners of war<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> on the cultivation of waste lands
in Italy itself, but we have no reason to think that much came of it.
And the true state of things was confessed in his abandonment of
Trajan’s great Province of Dacia. Aurelian withdrew<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> the army and the
provincials, whom he settled south of the Danube in Moesia; putting
the best face he could on this retirement by giving Moesia the name
of Dacia.</p>

<p>These phenomena attest an obvious truth, sometimes ignored, that
territorial expansion needs something more than military conquest to
give it lasting effect. In order to hold conquered lands the conquerors
must either occupy them or thoroughly assimilate the native population.
Emperors in this period became aware that they could do neither.
Alexander Severus (222-35) gained a great victory<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> over the Persians
and took a number of prisoners. It was a tradition of Persian kings
not to let their subjects pass into foreign slavery, and Alexander allowed
them to redeem these captives by a money payment. This he
used partly in compensating the masters of those who had already
passed into private ownership, and the rest he paid into the treasury.
This conciliatory policy may have been wise. In any case the treasury
was in this age chronically in need of ready money. But dealing with
the great oriental monarchy was a simpler undertaking than that of
dealing with the rude peoples of the North, who pressed on in tribal
units, offering no central power with which to negotiate. Probus (276-82)
seems to have been sorely troubled by their variety and independence
of action. We hear that when operating in Thrace he settled 100,000
Bastarnae<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> on Roman soil, and that all these kept faith with him. But
he went on to transplant large bodies of Gepidae Gruthungi and Vandals.
These all broke their faith. While Probus was busy putting
down pretenders in other parts of the empire, they went on raiding
expeditions at large by land and sea, defying and damaging the power
of Rome. True, the emperor broke them by force of arms, and drove
the remnant back to their wilds: but we can see what the biographer
ignores, that such raids did mischief which the empire was in no condition
to repair. What were the terms made with these barbarians, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
which the Bastarnae faithfully adhered, we are not told. Probably the
grant of lands carried with it the duty of furnishing recruits to Roman
armies and accepting the command of Roman officers.</p>

<p>In connexion with agricultural conditions we must not omit to
notice the change that was passing over Roman armies. The straits to
which Marcus had been reduced by the years of plague and losses in
the field had compelled him to raise fresh troops by any means, enrolling
slaves, hiring barbarian mercenaries, and so forth. With this
miscellaneous force he just managed to hold his ground in the North.
But the army never recovered its old tone. The period 180-284 shews
it going from bad to worse. It is full of sectional jealousy and losing
all sense of common imperial duty; only effective when some one
strong man destroys his rivals and is for the moment supreme. The
rise and fall of pretenders<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> is a main topic of the imperial history. As
from the foundation of the Empire, the numbers of the army were inadequate
for defence against simultaneous attacks on several frontiers.
The lack of cooperation among their enemies, and the mobility of
Roman frontier armies, had sufficed to keep invaders at bay. But as
pressure became more continuous it was more difficult to meet the
needs of the moment by moving armies to and fro. More and more
they took on the character of garrisons, their chief camps grew into
towns, local recruits filled up their ranks, and they were less and less
available for service as field-armies. But it was obviously necessary
that the country round about their quarters should be under cultivation,
in order to supply them with at least part of their food. It may safely
be assumed that this department was carefully attended to in the
formation of all these military stations. And it seems that under the
new conditions one of the evils that had hitherto embarrassed the empire
was gradually brought to an end. For the fact remains that, after
all the wholesale waste of lives in the bloody wars of the third century,
it was still possible to raise great and efficient armies. Reorganized by
Diocletian and Constantine, the empire proved able to defend itself
for many years yet, even in the West. The new system may have been
oppressive to the civil population, but it certainly revived military
strength. This could not have been achieved without an improvement
in the supply of man-power. It has been maintained<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> that this improvement
was due to the permanent settlements of barbarians, mostly
of German race, within the territories of the empire during the third
century. Whether planted on the vacant lands as alien settlers (<i>inquilini</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a>
on easy terms, but bound to provide recruits for the army, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
enlisted from the first and settled in permanent stations, they were
year by year raising large families and turning deserted border-lands
into nurseries of imperial soldiers. This picture may be somewhat
overdrawn, but it has the merit of accounting for the phenomena.
Without some explanation of the kind it is very hard to understand
how the empire came to survive at all. With it, the sequel appears
natural and intelligible. These barbarians were so far Romanized as
to be proud of becoming Romans: the empire was barbarized so far as
to lend itself to institutions of a more and more un-Roman character,
and to lose the remaining traditions of literature and art: and when
ruder barbarians in the fifth century assailed the empire in the West
they found the control of government already in the hands of kinsmen
of their own.</p>

<p>If we are to take the very meagre gleanings from the general
records of this period and combine them with the information gathered
from the African inscriptions referred to below, we can provisionally
form some sort of notion of the various classes of labour employed on
the land. First, there were <i>coloni</i>, freemen<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> in the eye of the law, however
much local conditions, or the terms of their tenancies and the
tendency for tenancies to become hereditary, may have limited the
practical use of their legal freedom. Secondly, there were, at least in
some parts, protected occupants encouraged to turn to account parcels
of land that had for some reason or other lain idle. Thirdly, there
were also rustic slaves who did most of the work on large farms. The
stipulated services of tenants<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> at certain seasons to some extent supplemented
their labour, at least in some parts: and the falling supply
of slaves tended to make such auxiliary services more important. For
the value of agricultural land depends mainly on the available supply
of labour. Fourthly, chiefly if not entirely in the northern Provinces,
a number of barbarians had been planted upon Roman soil. Some
entered peacefully and settled down as willing subjects of the empire
on vacant lands assigned to them. Some had surrendered after defeat
in battle, and came in as prisoners. But, instead of making them rustic
slaves on the old model, Marcus had found a new and better use for
them. A new status, that of <i>inquilini</i><a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> or ‘alien denizens’ was created,
inferior to that of free <i>coloni</i> but above that of slaves. They seem to
have been generally left to cultivate plots of land, paying a share of
the produce, and to have been attached to the soil, grouped under
Roman landlords or chief-tenants. They had their wives and families,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
and their sons recruited Roman armies. Lastly, we have no right to
assume that small cultivating owners<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> were wholly extinct, though
there can hardly have been many of them.</p>

<p>We have an account<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> of the rising in Africa (238 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>) which, so far
as it goes, gives us a little light on the agricultural situation there in
the middle of this period. The barbarian emperor Maximin was represented
in the Province by a <i>procurator fisci</i> whose oppressions provoked
a conspiracy against him. Some young men of good and wealthy
families drew together a number of persons who had suffered wrong.
They ordered their slaves<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> from the farms to assemble with clubs and
axes. In obedience<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> to their masters’ orders they gathered in the town
before daybreak, and formed a great mob. For Africa is naturally a
populous<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> country; so the tillers of the soil were numerous. After
dawn the young leaders told the mass of the slaves to follow them as
being a section of the general throng: they were to conceal their
weapons for the present, but valiantly to resist any attack on their
masters. The latter then met the procurator and assassinated him.
Hereupon his guards drew their swords meaning to avenge the murder,
but the countrymen in support of their masters<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> fell upon them with
their rustic weapons and easily routed them. After this the young
leaders, having gone too far to draw back, openly rebelled against
Maximin and proclaimed the proconsul Gordian Roman emperor. In
this passage we have before us young men of landlord families, apparently
holding large estates and working them with slave labour.
They are evidently on good terms with their slaves. Of tenant farmers
there is no mention: but there is a general reference to support given
by other persons, already wronged or afraid of suffering wrong. The
Latin biographer<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a>, who drew from Herodian, speaks of the murder as
the work of ‘the rustic common folk<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> and certain soldiers.’ Now
Frontinus<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>, writing in the latter part of the first century <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>, tells us that
in Africa on their great estates individuals had ‘a considerable population<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a>
of common folk.’ The language can hardly refer to slaves: and
a reference to levying recruits<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> for the army plainly forbids such an
interpretation. But it does not imply that there were no slaves employed
on those great estates; the writer is not thinking of the free-or-slave
labour question. In regard to the writers who record this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
particular episode, are we to suppose that by ‘slaves’ Herodian loosely
means <i>coloni</i>? Surely not. Then does Capitolinus by ‘rustic common
folk’ mean slaves? I cannot believe it. More probably the writer,
contemporary with Diocletian and Constantine, uses a loose expression
without any precise meaning. If we are to attempt any inference from
the language of Herodian, we must accept him as a witness that in
Africa, or at least in parts of Africa, agriculture was still being carried
on by slave labour. This does not exclude the existence of a small-tenancy
system side by side with it. And the state of things disclosed<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>
in the African inscriptions referred to above is consistent with both
systems: for that the manor-farm on a great estate employed a slave
staff for its regular operations, and drew from tenants’ services only
the help needed at certain seasons, seems the only possible conclusion
from the evidence. Therefore, while agreeing with Heisterbergk<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> that
the narrative of Herodian shews the populousness of Africa, we need
not go so far as to ignore the fact of a considerable farm-slave element
in the Province.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there are signs that rural Italy was suffering from the
disorders and insecurity that had so often hindered the prosperity of
agriculture. Even under the strong reign of Severus, with a larger
standing army in Italy than ever before, a daring brigand<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> remained
at large for two years and was only captured by treachery. Though we
do not hear of his attacking farmers directly, such a disturbance must
have been bad for all country folk. That he black-mailed them is probable:
that they were plundered and maltreated by the licentious soldiery
employed against him, is as nearly certain as can be from what we
know of the soldiery of this time.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLVII">XLVII. THE AFRICAN INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

<p>Certain inscriptions<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> from the Roman Province of Africa, dating
from the second and third centuries <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> or at least referring to matters
of that period, throw some light upon the management of great
imperial domains in that part of the world. To discuss these in full
one by one would be beyond the scope of this work, and would
require several chapters of intolerable length. I shall content myself
with giving a short account of each case, confined to those details<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
which have direct bearing on my subject and which can be gathered
with reasonable certainty from the often mutilated texts. French and
German savants have contributed freely to the deciphering and interpretation,
with happy results: but some of the proposed ‘restorations’
are much too bold to serve as a basis for further argument. After
the details, I purpose to consider the points common to these interesting
cases, and their place in the history of agriculture and
agricultural labour under the earlier Roman Empire, say from Trajan
to Severus.</p>

<p>(1) The inscription of Henschir Mettich<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> belongs to the year
116-7 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>, at the end of Trajan’s reign. It deals with a domain called
<i>fundus villae magnae Variani</i>, and does not refer to it by the term
<i>saltus</i> at all. There is no reference to arrears of rent, the <i>reliqua
colonorum</i> of which we often hear in the jurists and other writers. Indeed
there is no mention of money-rents, unless we reckon as such
the little dues (4 <i>as</i> per head) payable for grazing stock on the common
pasture. The <i>coloni</i> are <i>partiarii</i>, paying certain shares (generally ⅓)
of their yearly produce as rent. These are paid, not to an imperial
official but to the lords or head-tenants of the estate (<i>dominis aut conductoribus
eius fundi</i>) or to their stewards (<i>vilicis</i>). It seems certain
therefore that it was the chief tenants who were responsible to the
imperial treasury for the amounts annually due, and that upon them
rested the troublesome duty of collection. That this charge was a new
one, laid upon them by Trajan, is perhaps possible, but hardly probable.
For this statute regulating the domain (a <i>lex data</i>) is expressly
declared to be modelled on a <i>lex Manciana</i><a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a>, which can hardly be
other than a set of regulations issued by a former owner of the estate,
and adopted with modifications by the imperial agents (<i>procuratores</i>)
specially appointed to organize it as an imperial domain. In Roman
practice it was usual to follow convenient precedents. How long the
estate had become Crown-property, and by what process, inheritance
purchase confiscation etc, we do not know. Nor is it certain whether
the new statute was prepared as a matter of course on the cessation
of private ownership, or whether it was issued in response to an appeal
to the emperor complaining of oppressive exactions on the part of
the head-tenants. But of the latter situation there is no sign, and I
am inclined to accept the former alternative. In that case it appears
necessary to suppose that the system of letting a great estate to one
or a few great lessees, who might and did sublet parcels to small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
tenant farmers, was not unknown in the practice of great private landlords.
This may well have been the case in Africa, still populous and
prosperous, though such a system never took root in depopulated and
failing Italy. It required willingness on the part of men of substance
to risk their capital in a speculation that could only succeed if good
sub-tenants were to be found. This condition could not be fulfilled in
Italy, but in Africa things were very different.</p>

<p>It is however easier to note this difference by unmistakeable signs
than to ascertain it in detail. One point is clear. The <i>coloni</i> on this
domain were bound to render fixed services to the head-tenants at
certain seasons of the year. These services consisted of two days’
work (<i>operas binas</i>) at the times of ploughing hoeing and harvest, six
in all. The falling-off in the supply of slaves, despite occasional
captures of prisoners in war, was a consequence of the <i>pax Romana</i>,
and how to provide sufficient labour was a standing problem of agriculture.
The guarantee of extra labour at seasons of pressure was
doubtless a main consideration with speculators in inducing them to
venture their substance by becoming lessees of large tracts of land.
Of hired labour available for the purpose the statute gives no hint,
nor is it likely that such labourers were to be found in Africa. Thus
the <i>colonus</i>, and perhaps his whole household, were bound to certain
compulsory services, and thereby made part of an organization strictly
regulated and liable to further regulation. Further regulation was not
likely to give the peasant farmer more freedom of movement, since the
leading motive of the system was to secure continuous cultivation, and
this could best be secured by long tenancies, tending to become hereditary.
Therefore this statute offers various inducements to keep the peasant
contentedly engaged in bettering his own position by developing the
estate. The head-tenants are strictly forbidden to oppress him by
exacting larger shares of produce or more <i>operae</i> than are allowed by
the regulations. He is encouraged to cultivate parcels of waste land, not
included in his farm, by various privileges: in particular, a term of rent-free
years is guaranteed to him in case he plants the land with fruit
trees. This term, varying from five to ten years according to species
of trees, is meant to give him time to get a taste of profit before he becomes
liable to rent: its effect in making him loth to move is obvious.</p>

<p>The statute tells us nothing on another important point. From the
jurists and other sources<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a> we know that in Italy it was normally the
custom for the stock of a farm let to a <i>colonus</i> to be found for the
most part by the landlord. It was held<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> that in taking over this <i>instrumentum</i>
at a valuation the tenant virtually purchased it, of course not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
paying for it in ready money, but standing bound to account for the
amount on quitting the tenancy. Thus a small man was left free to
employ his own little capital in the actual working of the farm. He
could add to the stock, and his additions gave to the landlord a further
security for his rent, over and above that given by the sureties usually
required. What stock was found by landlords, and what by tenant, was
a matter for agreement generally following local convention. But on
this African domain we are not told how the question of <i>instrumentum</i>
was settled. Probably there was a traditional rule so well established
that no reference to the point in the statute seemed necessary. The
sole landlord was now the emperor. Without some direct evidence to
that effect, I can hardly suppose that the provision of farm stock was
entrusted to his <i>procuratores</i>. On the other hand, if the chief tenants,
the <i>conductores</i>, were expected to undertake this business, as if they
had been landlords, this too seems to call for direct evidence. Possibly
the need of finding stock for an African peasant farmer was not so
pressing as in Italy: still some equipment was surely required. How
it was provided, seems to me a question for answering which we have
not as yet sufficient materials. But it may be that on these domains
the practical necessity for dealing with it seldom occurred. If, when
the formal term of a tenancy expired, the same tenant stayed on either
by tacit renewal (<i>reconductio</i>) or by grant of a new lease, the stock
originally supplied would surely remain for use on the farm, upkeep
and renewals of particular articles being of course allowed for. If a
farmer’s son succeeded him as tenant, the situation would be the same,
or very nearly so. Therefore the manifest desire of emperors to keep
tenants in permanence probably operated to minimize questions of
<i>instrumentum</i> to the point of practical insignificance.</p>

<p>That the <i>coloni</i> on this estate were themselves handworkers can
hardly be doubted. The <i>operae</i> required of them suggest this on any
natural interpretation. But there is nothing to shew that they did not
employ<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> slave labour—if and when they could get it. We are not to
assume that they were all on one dead level of poverty. That the
head-tenants kept slaves to work those parts of the domain that they
farmed for their own account, is indicated by the mention of their
<i>vilici</i>, and made certain by the small amount of supplementary labour
guaranteed them in the form of tenants’ <i>operae</i>. Only one direct
mention of slaves (<i>servis dominicis</i>) occurs in the inscription, and the
text is in that place badly mutilated. Partly for the same defect, it
seems necessary to avoid discussing certain other details, such as the
position of the <i>stipendiarii</i> of whom we hear in a broken passage. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
do I venture to draw confident inferences from the references to
<i>inquilini</i> or <i>coloni inquilini</i>, or to discover an important distinction between
the tenants who actually resided on the estate and those who
did not. It may be right to infer a class of small proprietors dwelling
around on the skirts of the great domain and hiring parcels of land
within it. It may be right to regard the <i>inquilini</i> as <i>coloni</i> transplanted
from abroad and made residents on the estate. But until such conclusions
are more surely established it is safer to refrain from building
upon them. The general effect of this document is to give us outlines
of a system of imperial ‘peculiars,’ that is of domains on which
order and security, necessary for the successful working and continuous
cultivation, were not left to the operation of the ordinary
law, but guaranteed in each case by what we may call an imperial
by-law.</p>

<p>(2) The inscription of Souk el Khmis<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> deals with circumstances
between 180 and 183 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. The rescript of Commodus, and the appeal
to which it was the answer, are recorded in it. The imperial estate
to which it refers is called <i>saltus Burunitanus</i>. A single <i>conductor</i>
appears to have been the lessee of the whole estate, and it was against
his unlawful exactions that the <i>coloni</i> appealed. Through the connivance
of the responsible <i>procurator</i> (corruptly obtained, the <i>coloni</i>
hint,) this tyrant had compelled them to pay larger shares of produce
than were rightly due, and also to render services of men and beasts
beyond the amount fixed by statute. This abuse had existed on the
estate for some time, but the proceedings of the present <i>conductor</i> had
made it past all bearing. Evidently there had been some resistance,
but official favour had enabled him to employ military force in suppressing
it. Violence had been freely used: some persons had been
arrested and imprisoned or otherwise maltreated; others had been
severely beaten, among them even Roman citizens. Hence the appeal.
It is to be noted that the appellants in no way dispute their liability
to pay shares of produce (<i>partes agrarias</i>) or to render labour-services
at the usual seasons of pressure (<i>operarum praebitionem iugorumve</i>).
They refer to a clause in a <i>lex Hadriana</i>, regulating these dues. It is
against the exaction of more than this statute allows that they venture
to protest. They judiciously point out to the emperor that such doings
are injurious to the financial interest<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> of his treasury (<i>in perniciem
rationum tuarum</i>), that is, they will end by ruining the estate as a
source of steady revenue. The officials of the central department in
Rome were evidently of the same opinion, for the rescript of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
Commodus<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> plainly ordered his <i>procuratores</i> to follow closely the rules and
policy applicable to the domains, permitting no exactions in transgression
of the standing regulations (<i>contra perpetuam formam</i>). In
short, he reaffirmed the statute of Hadrian.</p>

<p>In this document also we hear nothing of tenants’ arrears or of
money-rents. Naturally enough, for the <i>coloni</i> are <i>partiarii</i> whose rent
is a share of produce. In connexion with such tenants the difficulty<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a>
of <i>reliqua</i> does not easily arise. They are labouring peasants, who
describe themselves as <i>homines rustici tenues manuum nostrarum operis
victum tolerantes</i>. Of course they are posing as injured innocents.
Perhaps they were: at any rate the great officials in Rome would look
kindly on humble peasants who only asked protection in order to go
on unmolested, producing the food which it was their duty to produce,—food,
by the by, of the need of which the Roman mob was a
standing reminder. Of <i>vilici</i> or ordinary slaves this document says
nothing, for it had no need to do so; but the right to <i>operae</i> at certain
seasons implies slave labour on the head-tenant’s own farm, probably
attached to the chief <i>villa</i> or <i>palatium</i>. In a notable phrase at the end
of their appeal the <i>coloni</i> speak of themselves<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> as ‘your peasants,
home-bred slaves and foster-children of your domains’ (<i>rustici tui
vernulae et alumni saltuum tuorum</i>). Surely this implies, not only that
they are <i>coloni Caesaris</i>, standing in a direct relation to the emperor
whose protection<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> they implore against the <i>conductores agrorum
fiscalium</i>; but also that their connexion with the estate is an old-established
one, passing from fathers to sons, a hereditary tie which they
have at present no wish to see broken.</p>

<p>In this case the circumstances that led to the setting-up of the
inscription are clear enough. Evidently the appeal represented a great
effort, both in the way of organizing concerted action on the part of
the peasant farmers, and in overcoming the hindrances to its presentation
which would be created by the interested ingenuity of those
whose acts were thereby called in question. The imperial officials in
the Provinces were often secretly in league with those in authority at
Rome, and to have procured an imperial rescript in favour of the
appellants was a great triumph, perhaps a rare one. The <i>forma perpetua</i>
containing the regulations governing the estate was, we learn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
already posted up on a bronze tablet. It had been disregarded: and
now it was an obvious precaution to record that the emperor had
ordered those regulations to be observed in future. How long the
effect of this rescript lasted we are left to guess. Officials changed,
and reaffirmation of principles could not guarantee permanent reform
of practice. Still, the policy of the central bureau, when not warped
by corrupt influence, was consistent and clear. To keep these imperial
‘peculiars’ on such a footing as to insure steady returns was an undoubted
need: and, after the extreme strain on the resources of the
empire imposed by the calamitous times of Marcus, it was in the reign
of Commodus a greater need than ever.</p>

<p>(3) The Gazr Mezuâr inscription<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a>, very fragmentary and in some
points variously interpreted, belongs to the same period (181 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>). A
few details seem sufficiently certain to be of use here. The estate in
question is imperial property, apparently one of the domanial units
revealed to us by these African documents. It seems to record another
case of appeal against unlawful exaction of <i>operae</i>, probably by a
<i>conductor</i> or <i>conductores</i>. It also was successful. But it is notable that
the lawful amount of <i>operae</i> to be rendered by <i>coloni</i> on this estate
was just double of that fixed in the other cases—four at each of the
seasons of pressure, twelve in all. We can only infer that the task-scale
varied on various estates for reasons unknown to us. One fragment,
if a probable restoration<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> is to be accepted, conveys the impression
of a despairing threat on the part of the appellants. It suggests
that on failure of redress they may be driven to return to their homes
where they can make their abode in freedom. On the face of it, this
is an assertion of freedom of movement, a valuable piece of evidence,
if it can be trusted. We may safely go so far as to note that it is at
least not inconsistent with other indications pointing to the same
conclusion. We may even remark that the suggestion of going home
in search of freedom agrees better with the notion that these <i>coloni</i>
were African natives than with the supposition of their Italian origin.
The Roman citizens on the Burunitan estate will not support the
latter view, for they are mentioned as exceptional. Seeck (rightly, I
think,) urges that Italy was in sore need of men and had none to spare
for populous Africa. I would add that the emigration of Italians to
the Provinces as working farmers seems to require more proof than
has yet been produced. As officials, as traders, as financiers and petty
usurers, as exploiters of other men’s labour, they abounded in the
subject countries; but, so far as I can learn, not as labourers. Many
of them no doubt held landed estates, for instance in the southern
parts of Spain and Gaul. But when we meet with loose general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
expressions<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> such as ‘The Roman is dwelling in every land that he has
conquered,’ we must not let them tempt us into overestimating the
number of Italian settlers taking an active part in the operations of
provincial agriculture.</p>

<p>(4) The inscription of Ain Ouassel<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> belongs to the end of the reign
of Severus. The text is much broken, but information of no small
importance can be gathered from what remains. Severus was himself
a native of Africa, and may have taken a personal interest in the
subject of this ordinance. In point of form the document chiefly consists
of a quoted communication (<i>sermo</i>) from the emperor’s <i>procuratores</i><a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a>,
one of whom, a freedman, saw to its publication in an inscription on
an <i>ara legis divi Hadriani</i>. A copy of the <i>lex Hadriana</i>, or at least
the relevant clauses thereof, was included. The matter on which the
emperor’s decision is announced was the question of the right to occupy
and cultivate rough lands (<i>rudes agri</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a>, which are defined as lands
either simply waste or such as the <i>conductores</i> have neglected to
cultivate for at least ten years preceding. These lands are included
in no less than five different <i>saltus</i> mentioned by proper names, and
the scope of the ordinance is wider than in the cases referred to
above. It appears that, while it may have contained some modifications
or extensions of the provisions of the <i>lex Hadriana</i>, its main bearing
was to reaffirm and apply the privileges granted by that statute. It
is not rash to infer that we have here evidence of a set of regulations
for all or many of the African domains, forming a part of Hadrian’s
great work of reorganization.</p>

<p>If the remaining words of this inscription are rightly interpreted,
as I think they are, it seems that the policy of encouraging the cultivation
of waste and derelict lands was at this time being revived by
the government. We have seen it at work in Trajan’s time, promoted
by guarantee of privileges and temporary exemption from burdens.
But the persons then encouraged to undertake the work of reclamation
were to all appearance only the <i>coloni</i> at the time resident on the
estate. In the case of these five <i>saltus</i>, the offer seems to be made
more widely, at least so far as the remaining text may justify such
conclusions. It reads like an attempt to attract enterprising squatters
of any kind from any quarter. They are offered not merely undisturbed
occupation and a heritable tenure of some sort, but actual <i>possessio</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
Now this right, which fills a whole important chapter in Roman law,
was one protected by special legal remedies, and even on an imperial
domain can hardly have been a matter of indifference. It was quite
distinct from mere <i>possessio naturalis</i><a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a>, which was all that the ordinary
<i>colonus</i> enjoyed on his own behalf. This new-type squatter is allowed
the same privilege of so many years of grace, free of rent, at the outset
of his enterprise, that we have noted above. The details are somewhat
different. For olives the free term is ten years: for fruit trees (<i>poma</i>,
here mentioned without reference to vines) it is seven years. It is
expressly provided that the <i>divisio</i>, which implies the partiary system
of tenancy, shall apply only to such <i>poma</i> as are actually brought<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> to
market. This suggests that in the past attempts to levy the quota as
a proportional share of the gross crop, without regard to the needs of
the grower’s own household, had been found to discourage reclamation.
It has been pointed out that the effect of the new policy would be to
create a sort of perpetual leasehold, similar to that known by the
Greek term <i>emphyteusis</i>, which is found fully established in the later
empire. But the land was not all under fruit-crops. The disposal of
corn crops is regulated in a singular clause thus. ‘Any shares of dry<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a>
crops that shall be due are, during the first five years of occupation,
to be delivered to the head-tenant within whose holding<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> the land
occupied is situate. After the lapse of that time they are to go to the
account (of the Treasury<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>).’ Why is the <i>conductor</i> to receive these
<i>partes aridae</i>? It is reasonably suggested that the intention was to
obviate initial obstruction on the part of the big lessee, and thus to
give the reclamation-project a fair start.</p>

<p>For we have no right to assume that the parcels of land thrown
open to occupation had hitherto been included<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> in no tenancy. The
whole import of the document shews that they often belonged to this
or that area held by one or other of the big lessees. That there was
at least one <i>conductor</i> to each of the five <i>saltus</i> seems certain. That
there was only one to each, is perhaps probable, but hardly to be
gathered from the text. Now, so long as the <i>conductor</i> regularly paid
his fixed rent (<i>canon</i>) and accounted for the taxes (<i>tributa</i>) due from
the estate, why should the imperial authority step in to take pieces
of land (and that the poorest land) out of his direct control? The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
answer to this is that the Roman law<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> recognized the right of a private
landlord to require of his tenants that they should not ‘let down’
the land leased to them: and proof of neglected cultivation might
operate to bar a tenant’s claim for abatement of rent. What was the
right of an ordinary landlord was not likely to be waived by an
emperor: though his domains might be administered in fact by a
special set of fiscal regulations, he claimed a right analogous to that
recognized by the ordinary law, and none could challenge its exercise.
A big lessee might often find that parts of his holding could not be
cultivated at a profit under existing conditions. Slave labour was careless
and inefficient; it was in these times also costly, so costly that it
only paid to employ it on generous soils. The task-work of <i>coloni</i> did
not amount to much, and it was no doubt rendered grudgingly. He
was tempted to economize in slaves<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> and to employ his reduced staff
on the best land only. We need not suppose that he got an abatement
of his fixed rent from the fiscal authorities: he was most unlikely to
attract their attention by making such a claim. He had made his
bargain with eyes presumably open. That he had agreed to the <i>canon</i>
assures us that it must have been low enough to leave him a comfortable
margin for profit. We may be fairly sure that he sat quiet and
did what seemed to pay him best.</p>

<p>In the remaining text of this statute there is no reference to <i>operae</i>
due from the new squatters, and nothing is said of <i>coloni</i>. This does
not seem to be due to injury of the stone. The persons for whose
benefit the statute is enacted are apparently a new or newly recognized
element<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> in the population of these domains, not <i>coloni</i>. But the rights
offered to them are expressly referred to as rights granted by the
statute of Hadrian. If so, then the <i>lex Hadriana</i> contemplated the establishment
of a new peasant class, not <i>coloni</i>, and the present statute
was merely a revival of Hadrian’s scheme. The men are eventually to
pay shares of crops, and Schulten’s<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> view, that they are on the way to
become <i>coloni</i>, is possible, if not probable. When he remarks that they
might find the position of <i>coloni</i> a doubtful boon, we need not challenge
his opinion.</p>

<p>(5) The inscription of Ain el Djemala<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>, a later discovery (1906) is
of special importance as belonging to the same neighbourhood as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
preceding one. It is a document of Hadrian’s time. It refers to the
same group of estates as the above, and deals with the same matter,
the right to cultivate waste or derelict parcels of land. Indeed the connexion
of the two inscriptions is so close that the parts preserved of
each can be safely used to fill gaps in the text of the other. In a few
points this inscription, the earlier in date, supplies further detail. The
most notable is that another estate, a <i>saltus</i> or <i>fundus Neronianus</i>,
is mentioned in it, and not in the later one. Thus it would seem that
it referred to six estates, a curious coincidence, when we recall the six
great African landlords made away with by Nero. Another little addition
is that waste lands are defined as marshy or wooded. Also that
the land is spoken of as fit for growing olives vines and corn-crops,
which supplements a mutilated portion of the Ain Ouassel stone. But
in one point the difference between the two is on the face of it difficult
to reconcile. In addressing the imperial <i>procuratores</i> the applicants
base their request on the <i>lex Manciana</i>, the benefit of which they seek
to enjoy<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> as used on the neighbouring <i>saltus Neronianus</i>. Here the
broken text is thought to have contained a reference to the enhanced
prosperity of that estate owing to the concession. In any case we may
fairly conclude that the <i>lex Manciana</i> was well known in the district,
and its regulations regarded by the farmers as favourable to their interests.
But the reply to their petition does not refer to it as the immediate
basis of the decision given. The communication (<i>sermo</i>) of
Hadrian’s procurators is cited as the ground of the leave granted for
cultivation of waste lands. Yet the broken sentence at the end of the
inscription seems at least to shew that the rules of the <i>lex Manciana</i>
were still recognized as a standard, confirmed and perhaps incorporated,
or referred to by name, in the <i>lex Hadriana</i> itself. It is ingeniously
suggested that the farmers rest their case on the <i>Manciana</i> because the
<i>Hadriana</i> was as yet unknown to them; while the reply refers to Hadrian’s
statute as authority. Whether the <i>saltus</i> or <i>fundus Neronianus</i>,
on which the Mancian regulations were in force, is another estate-unit
similar to the five named both here and in the later inscription, is a
point on which I have some doubts, too little connected with my subject
for discussion here. The general scope of the concession granted
by Hadrian is the same as the later one of Severus.</p>

<p>If Hadrian issued a statute or statutes regulating the terms of
occupancy on the African domains, and some attempts to evade it
were met by its reaffirmation under Commodus, it is quite natural that
neglect or evasion of it in some other respects should be met by reaffirmation
under Severus. This consideration will account for the
identity of the concessions granted in these two inscriptions. And it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
agrees perfectly with the evidence of later legislation in the Theodosian
code. The normal course of events is, legislation to protect the poorer
classes of cultivators, then evasion of the law by the selfish rich, then
reenactment of evaded laws, generally with increased penalties. That
under the administrative system of the domains much the same phenomena
should occur, is only what we might expect.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">XLVIII. DISCUSSION OF THE ABOVE INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

<p>In reviewing the state of things revealed to us by these inscriptions
we must carefully bear in mind that they relate solely to the Province
Africa. Conditions there were in many ways exceptional. When Rome
took over this territory after the destruction of Carthage in 146 <span class="allsmcap">BC</span>, it
was probably a country divided for the most part into great estates
worked on the Carthaginian system by slave labour. Gradually the
land came more and more into the hands of Roman capitalists, to
whose opulence Horace refers. Pliny tells us that in Nero’s time six<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>
great landlords possessed half the entire area of the Province, when
that emperor found a pretext for putting them to death and confiscating
their estates. Henceforth the ruling emperor was the predominating
landlord<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> in a Province of immense importance, in particular as
a chief granary of Rome. We are not to suppose that any change in
the system of large units was ever contemplated. Punic traditions,
probably based on experience, favoured the system; though the Punic
language, still spoken, seems to have been chiefly confined to the seaboard
districts. What the change of lordship effected was not only to
the financial advantage of the imperial treasury: it also put an end to
the creation of what were a sort of little principalities that might some
day cause serious trouble. At this point we are tempted to wonder
whether the great landlords, before the sweeping measure of Nero,
had taken any steps towards introducing a new organization in the
management of their estates. Trajan’s statute refers to a <i>lex Manciana</i>
and adopts a number of its regulations. These regulations clearly contemplate
a system of head-tenants and sub-tenants, of whom the latter
seem to be actual working farmers living of the labour of their own
hands, as those who some 65 years later described themselves in appealing
to Commodus. The former have stewards in charge of the
cultivation of the ‘manor farms’ attached to the principal farmsteads,
and evidently employ gangs of slaves: but at special seasons have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
right to a limited amount<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> of task-labour from the free sub-tenants of
the small farms. That these labour-conditions were devised to meet a
difficulty in procuring enough slaves to carry on the cultivation of the
whole big estate, is an inference hardly to be resisted. That we find it
on more than one estate indicates that for the time it was serving its
purpose. But, in admitting that it probably began under the rule of
great private landlords, we must not lose sight of the fact that it was
liable to grievous abuse, and that even the regulations of Hadrian did
not remove the necessity of pitiful appeals for redress.</p>

<p>An important characteristic of these estates was that they were
outside the municipal<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> system. Each of the so-called <i>civitates</i> had its
own charter or statute (<i>lex</i>) conforming more or less closely to a
common<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> model, under which the municipal authorities could regulate
the management of lands within its territory. But these great estates
were independent<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> of such local jurisdictions. And this independence
would seem to date from the times of private ownership, before the
conversion of many of them into imperial domains. Mommsen thought
that this separate treatment of them as ‘peculiars’ began in Italy
under the Republic, and was due to the influence of the landowning
aristocracy, who were bent upon admitting no such concurrent authority
on their <i>latifundia</i>. This may have been so, and the extension
of large-scale possessions to the Provinces may have carried the system
abroad. At all events there it was, and it suited the convenience of a
grasping emperor: he had only to get rid of the present possessor and
carry on the administration of the domain as before: his agents stepped
into the place of those employed by the late landlord, and only slight
modification of the current regulations would be required. He issued
a statute for management of ‘crown-property’ as he would for a municipality.
It was in effect a local law, and it does not appear that the
common law administered by the ordinary courts could override it.
The imperial <i>procurator</i> was practically the magistrate charged with
its administration in addition to his financial duties, for government
and extraction of revenue were really two sides of the same function.
Obviously the interests of the emperor, of his agent, of the head-tenants,
and of the peasant cultivators, were not the same. But the peasant,
who wanted to pay as little as possible, and the emperor who wanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
to receive steady returns—as large as possible, but above all things
steady—had a common interest in preventing unlawful exactions, by
which a stable income was imperilled and the prosperity of the cultivator
impaired. On the other hand the <i>procurator</i> and the <i>conductor</i>
could only make illicit profits through combining to rob the emperor
by squeezing his <i>coloni</i>. How to accomplish this was no doubt a matter
of delicate calculation. How much oppression would the <i>coloni</i> stand
without resorting to the troublesome and risky process of an appeal?
We only hear of one or two appeals made with success. Of those that
were made and rejected or foiled by various arts, and of those abandoned
in despair at an early stage, we get no record. Yet that such
cases did occur, perhaps not seldom, we may be reasonably sure.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that Columella, in whose treatise letting of
farms to tenants first appears, not as an occasional expedient but as
part of a reasoned scheme of estate-management, makes provision for
a <i>procurator</i><a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> as well as a <i>vilicus</i>. One duty of the former is to keep an
eye on the latter. In the management of great estates an atmosphere
of mistrust is perhaps to some extent unavoidable. In an agricultural
system based on slave labour, this mistrust begins at the very bottom
of the structure and reaches to the very top, as is shewn by all experience
ancient and modern. Industry in slaves, diligence and honesty
in agents and stewards, are not to be relied on when these subordinates
have no share in the profit derived from the practice of such virtues.
And mistrust of slaves and freedmen did not imply a simple trust in
free tenants. Columella only advises<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> letting to tenants in circumstances
that make it impracticable to cultivate profitably by a slave-staff under
a steward. The plan is a sort of last resort, and it can only work well
if the tenants stay on continuously. Therefore care should be taken to
make the position of the <i>coloni</i> permanently attractive. This advice is
primarily designed for Italy, but its principles are of general application,
and no doubt justified by experience. Their extension to <i>latifundia</i>
abroad, coupled with a falling-off in the supply of slaves, led
to similar results: great estates might still be in part worked by slave
labour under stewards, but letting parcels to small tenants became a
more and more vital feature of the system. But to deal directly from
a distance with a number of such peasant farmers would be a troublesome
business. We need not wonder that it became customary to let
large blocks of land, even whole <i>latifundia</i>, to big lessees, speculative
men who undertook the subletting and rent-collecting of part of their
holdings, while they could work the central manor-farm by slave labour
on their own account, and generally exploit the situation for their own
profit. Thus, as once the <i>latifundium</i> had absorbed little properties,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
so now its subdivision was generating little tenancies, with chief-tenants
as a sort of middlemen between the <i>dominus</i> and the <i>coloni</i>.
To protect the <i>colonus</i>, the powers of the <i>conductor</i><a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> had to be strictly
limited: to ease the labour-problem and retain the <i>conductor</i>, a certain
amount of task-work had to be required of the <i>colonus</i>. And this last
condition was ominous of the coming serfdom.</p>

<p>If the economic situation and the convenience of non-resident
landlords operated to produce a widespread system of letting to small
tenants, it was naturally an object to levy the rents in such a form as
would best secure a safe and regular return. To exact a fixed money-rent
would mean that the peasant must spend time in marketing his
produce in order to procure the necessary cash, and thereby lessen the
time spent in actual farm-labour. In bad years he would look for an
abatement of his rent, nor would it be easy to satisfy him: here was
material for disputes and discontent. Such difficulties were known in
Italy and elsewhere, and jurists recognized<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> an advantage of the
‘partiary’ system in this connexion. An abatement of rent due in a
particular year need not imply that the landlord lost the amount of
abatement for good and all. If the next year produced a ‘bumper’
crop, the landlord was entitled to claim restitution of last year’s abatement
in addition to the yearly rent. This too, it seems, in the case of
a tenant sitting at a fixed money-rent. But the <i>partiarius colonus</i> is
on another footing: he shares gain and loss with the <i>dominus</i>, with
whom he is a quasi-partner<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a>. It was surely considerations of this kind
that led to the adoption of the share-rent system on these great African
estates. By fixing the proportion on a moderate scale, the peasant
was fairly certain to be able to pay his rent, and he would not be
harassed with money transactions dependent on the fluctuations in
the price of corn. Under such conditions he was more likely to be
contented and to stay on where he was, and that this should be so was
precisely what the landlord desired. On the other hand the big <i>conductor</i>
might pay rent either in coin or kind. He was a speculator,
doubtless well able to take care of his own interests: probably the
normal case was that he agreed to a fixed cash payment, and only
took the lease on terms that left him a good prospect of making it a
remunerative venture. But on this point there is need of further
evidence.</p>

<p>When the emperor took over an estate of this kind, such an existing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
organization would be admirably fitted to continue under the fiscal
administration. Apparently this is just what happened. One small
but important improvement would be automatically produced by the
change. The <i>coloni</i> would now become <i>coloni Caesaris</i><a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> and whatever
protection against exactions of <i>conductores</i> they may have enjoyed
under the sway of their former lords was henceforth not less likely to
be granted and much more certain of effect. To the fiscal officials any
course of action tending to encourage permanent tenancies and steady
returns would on the face of it be welcome: for it was likely to save
them trouble, if not to bring them credit. The only influence liable to
incline them in another direction was corruption in some form or other,
leading them to connive at misdeeds of the local agents secretly in
league with the head-lessees on the spot. That cases of such connivance
occurred in the period from Trajan to Severus is not to be
doubted. During the following period of confusion they probably became
frequent. But it was not until Diocletian introduced a more
elaborate imperial system, and increased imperial burdens to defray
its greater cost, that the evil reached its height. Then the corruption
of officials tainted all departments, and was the canker ever gnawing
at the vital forces of the empire. But that this deadly corruption was
a sudden growth out of an existing purity is not to be imagined. All
this is merely an illustration of that oldest of political truisms, that to
keep practice conformable to principle is supremely difficult. The only
power that seems to be of any effect in checking the decay of departmental
virtue is the power of public opinion. Now a real public opinion
cannot be said to have existed in the Roman Empire; and, had it
existed, there was no organ through which it could be expressed. And
the Head of the State, let him be ever so devoted to the common
weal, was too overburdened with manifold responsibilities to be able
to give personal attention to each complaint and prescribe an equitable
remedy.</p>

<p>How far we are entitled to trace a movement of policy by the contents
of these African inscriptions is doubtful. They are too few, and
too much alike. Perhaps we may venture to detect a real step onward
in the latest of them. The renewal of the encouragement of squatter-settlers<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a>
on derelict lands does surely point to a growing consciousness
that the food-question was becoming a more and more serious one.
Perhaps it may be taken to suggest that the system of leasing the
African domains to big <i>conductores</i> had lately been found failing in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
efficiency. But it is rash to infer much from a single case: and the
African Severus may have followed an exceptional policy in his native
province. It is when we look back from the times of the later Empire,
with its frantic legislation to bind <i>coloni</i> to the soil, and to enforce the
cultivation of every patch of arable ground, that we are tempted to
detect in every record symptoms of the coming constraint. As yet the
central government had not laid its cramping and sterilizing hand on
every part of its vast dominions. Moreover the demands on African
productivity had not yet reached their extreme limit. There was as
yet no Constantinople, and Egypt still shared with Africa the function
of supplying food to Rome. Thus it is probably reasonable to believe
that the condition of the working tenant-farmers was in this age a
tolerable<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> one. If those on the great domains were bit by bit bound
to their holdings, it was probably with their own consent, so far at
least that, seeing no better alternative, they became stationary and
more or less dependent peasants. In other parts of Africa, for instance
near Carthage, we hear of wealthy landowners employing bodies of
slaves. Some of these men may well have been Italians: at least they
took a leading part later in the rising against Maximin and the elevation
of Gordian.</p>

<p>In connexion with the evidence of this group of inscriptions it
may be not out of place to say a few words on the view set forth by
Heisterbergk, that the origin of the later serf-colonate was Provincial,
not Italian. He argues<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> that what ruined small-scale farming in Italy
was above all things the exemption of Italian land from taxation.
Landlords were not constrained by the yearly exaction of dues to
make the best economic use of their estates. Vain land-pride and
carelessness were not checked: mismanagement and waste had free
course, and small cultivation declined. The fall in free rustic population
was both effect and cause. In the younger Pliny’s time good
tenants were already hard to find, but great landlords owned parks and
mansions everywhere. In the Provinces nearly all the land was subject
to imperial taxation in kind or in money, and owners could not
afford to let it lie idle. The practical control of vast estates was not
possible from a distance. The direction of agriculture, especially of
extensive farming (corn etc) from a fixed centre was little less difficult.
There was therefore strong inducement to delegate the business of
cultivation to tenants, and to let the difference in amount between
their rents and the yearly imperial dues represent the landlord’s profit.
Thus the spread of <i>latifundia</i> swallowed up small holdings in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
Provinces as in Italy; but it converted small owners into small tenants,
and did not merge the holdings into large slave-gang plantations or
throw them into pasture. The plan of leasing a large estate as a
whole to a big head-tenant, or establishing him in the central ‘manor
farm,’ was quite consistent with the general design, and this theory
accounts for the presence of a population of free <i>coloni</i>, whom later
legislation might and did bind fast to the soil.</p>

<p>This argument has both ingenuity and force, but we can only
assent to it with considerable reservations. Letting to free <i>coloni</i> was
a practice long used in Italy, and in the first century <span class="allsmcap">AD</span> was evidently
becoming more common. It was but natural that it should appear in
the Provinces. Still, taken by itself, there is no obvious reason why it
should develope into serfdom. With the admitted scarcity and rising
value of labour, why was it that the freeman did not improve his position
in relation to his lord, indeed to capitalists in general? I think
the presence of the big lessee, the <i>conductor</i>, an employer of slave
labour, had not a little to do with it. Labour as such was despised.
The requirement of task-work to supplement that of slaves on the
‘manor farm’ was not likely to make labour more esteemed. Yet to
get his little holding the <i>colonus</i> had to put up with this condition. It
may be significant that we hear nothing of <i>coloni</i> working for wages in
spare time. Was it likely that they would do so? Then, when the
<i>conductor</i> came to be employed as collector of rents and other dues on
the estate, his opportunities of illicit exaction gave him more and
more power over them; and, combined with their reluctance to migrate
and sacrifice the fruits of past labour, reduced them<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> more and more
to a state of <i>de facto</i> dependence. At the worst they would be semi-servile
in fact, though free in law; at the best they would have this
outlook, without any apparent alternative to escape their fate. This, I imagine,
was the unhappy situation that was afterwards recognized by law.</p>

<p>I must not omit to point out that I have said practically nothing
on the subject<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> of municipal lands and their administration by the
authorities of the several <i>res publicae</i> or <i>civitates</i>. Of the importance
of this matter I am well aware, more particularly in connexion with
the development of <i>emphyteusis</i> under the perpetual leases granted by
the municipalities. In a general history of the imperial economics this
topic would surely claim a significant place. But it seems to have
little or no bearing on the labour conditions with which I am primarily
concerned, while it would add greatly to the bulk of a treatise already
too long. So too the incidence of taxation, and the effects of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
degradation<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> of the currency, influences that both played a sinister part in imperial
economics, belong properly to a larger theme. Even the writers
on land-surveying etc, the <i>agrimensores</i> or <i>gromatici</i>, only touch my
subject here and there when it is necessary to speak of tenures, which
cannot be ignored in relation to labour-questions. All these matters
are thoroughly and suggestively treated in Seeck’s great history of the
Decline and Fall of the ancient world. Another topic left out of discussion
is the practical difference, if any, between the terms<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> <i>fundus</i>
and <i>saltus</i> in the imperial domains. I can find no satisfactory materials
for defining it, and it does not appear to bear any relation to the
labour-question. The meaning of the term <i>inquilinus</i> is a more important
matter. If we are to accept Seeck’s ingenious conclusions<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a>, it
follows that this term, regularly used by the jurists of a house-tenant
(urban) as opposed to <i>colonus</i> a tenant of land (rustic), in the course of
the second century began to put on a new meaning. Marcus settled
large numbers of barbarians on Roman soil. These ‘indwellers’ were
labelled as <i>inquilini</i>, a word implying that they were imported aliens,
distinct from the proper residents. An analogous distinction existed
in municipalities between unprivileged ‘indwellers’ (<i>incolae</i>) and real
<i>municipes</i>. Now a jurist’s opinion<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> in the first half of the third century
speaks of <i>inquilini</i> as attached (<i>adhaerent</i>) to landed estates, and only
capable of being bequeathed to a legatee by inclusion in the landed
estate: and it refers to a rescript of Marcus and Commodus dealing
with a point of detail connected with this rule of law. Thus the
<em class="gesperrt">inquilinate</em> seems to have been a new condition implying attachment
to the soil, long before the <em class="gesperrt">colonate</em> acquired a similar character.
For the very few passages, in which the fixed and dependent nature
of the colonate is apparently recognized before the time of Constantine,
are with some reason suspected of having been tampered with by
the compilers of the Digest, or are susceptible of a different interpretation.
It is clear that this intricate question cannot be fully discussed
here. If these rustic <i>inquilini</i> were in their origin barbarian settlers,
perhaps two conclusions regarding them may be reasonable. First,
they seem to be distinct from slaves, the personal property of individual
owners. For the evidence, so far as it goes, makes them attached<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
to the land, and only transferable therewith. Secondly, they are surely
labourers, tilling with their own hands the holdings assigned to them.
If this view of them be sound, we may see in them the beginnings of
a serf class. But it does not follow that the later colonate was a direct
growth from this beginning. We have noted above several other causes
contributing to that growth; in particular the state of <i>de facto</i> fixity
combined with increasing dependence, in which the free <i>colonus</i> was
gradually losing his freedom. Whether the later colonate will ever
receive satisfactory explanation in the form of a simple and convincing
theory, I cannot tell: at present it seems best to admit candidly that,
among the various influences tending to produce the known result, I
do not see my way<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> to distinguish one as supremely important, and to
ignore the effect of others. The opinion<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> of de Coulanges, that the
origin of the later colonate is mainly to be sought in the gradual effect
of custom (local custom), eventually recognized (not created) by law,
is perhaps the soundest attempt at a brief expression of the truth.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XLIX">XLIX. THE JURISTS OF THE DIGEST.</h3>

<p>For the position of the <i>colonus</i> in Roman Law during the period
known as that of the ‘classic’ Jurists we naturally find our chief source
of evidence in the Digest. And it is not surprising that here and there
we find passages bearing on labour-questions more or less directly.
But in using this evidence it is most necessary to keep in mind the
nature and scope of this great compilation. First, it is not a collection
of laws. Actual laws were placed in the Codex, based on previous
Codes such as the Theodosian (439 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>), after a careful process of sifting
and editing, with additions to complete the work. This great task
was performed by Justinian’s commissioners in 14 months or less.
The Justinian Code was confirmed and published in 529 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>, and
finally in a revised form rather more than five years later. Secondly,
the Digest is a collection of opinions of lawyers whose competence and
authority had been officially recognized, and whose <i>responsa</i> carried
weight in the Roman courts. From early times interpretation had
been found indispensable in the administration of the law; and in the
course of centuries, both by opinions on cases and by formal treatises,
there had grown up such a mass of written jurisprudence as no man
could master. These writings were specially copious in the ‘classic’
period (say from Hadrian to Alexander 117-235). Actual laws are
sometimes cited in the form of imperial decisions, finally settling some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
disputed point. But the normal product of discussion is the opinion of
this or that eminent jurist as to what is sound law in a particular
question. The different opinions of different authorities are often
quoted side by side. If this were all, we might congratulate ourselves
on having simply a collection of authentic extracts from named
authors, conveying their views in their own words. And no doubt
many of the extracts are of this character.</p>

<p>But the position is not in fact so simple as this. Tribonian and his
fellow-commissioners were set to work at the end of the year 530.
Their task was completed and the <i>Digesta</i> published with imperial
confirmation at the end of 533. Now the juristic literature in existence,
of which the Digest was to be an epitome superseding its own
sources, was of such prodigious bulk that three years cannot have
been sufficient for the work. To read, abstract, classify, and so far as
possible to harmonize, this mass of complicated material, was a duty
surely needing a much longer time for its satisfactory performance.
Moreover, as this official Corpus of jurisprudence was designed for
reference and citation as an authority in the courts, it had to be<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a>
brought up to date. That this necessity greatly increased the commissioners’
burden is obvious: nor less so, that it was a duty peculiarly
difficult to discharge in haste, and liable, if hurried, to result in
obscurities inconsistencies and oversights. That much of the Digest
has suffered from overhaste in its production is now generally admitted.
Its evidence is therefore to be used with caution. But on the
subject of <i>coloni</i> the main points of interest are attested by witnesses
of high authority, such as Ulpian, in cited passages not reasonably
suspected of interpolation. And it is not necessary to follow up a host
of details. We have only to reconstruct from the law-sources the
characteristic features of agriculture and rustic tenancy as it existed
before the time of Diocletian; and these features are on the whole
significant and clear. Fortunately we are not entirely dependent on
collection and comparison of scattered references from all parts of the
great compilation. One title (<span class="allsmcap">XIX</span> 2 <i>locati conducti</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> furnishes us with
a quantity of relevant matter classified under one head by the editors
themselves.</p>

<p>First and foremost it stands out quite clear that the <i>colonus</i> is a
free man, who enters into a legal contract as lessee with lessor, and
that landlord and tenant are equally bound by the terms of the lease.
If any clause requires interpretation owing to special circumstances
having arisen, the jurist endeavours to lay down the principles by
which the court should be guided to an equitable decision. For instance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
any fact by which the productiveness of a farm and therewith
the solvency of the tenant are impaired may lead to a dispute. Care
is therefore taken to relieve the tenant of responsibility for damage
inflicted by irresistible force (natural or human)<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> or due to the landlord’s
fault. But defects of climate and soil<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> give no claim to relief,
since he is presumed to have taken the farm with his eyes open: nor
does the failure of worn-out fruit trees, which tenants were regularly
bound by their covenant to replace. The chief rights of the landlord<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>
are the proper cultivation of the farm and regular payment of the rent.
In these the law duly protects him. The tenant is bound not to let
down the land by neglect, or to defraud<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> the landlord by misappropriating
what does not belong to him: rent is secured normally by
sureties (<i>fideiussores</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> found by the tenant at the time of leasing, or
sometimes by the fact that all property of his on the farm is expressly
pledged<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> to the lessor on this account. Thus it is the aim of the law
to guard the presumably poorer and humbler party against hard treatment,
while it protects the man of property against fraud. In other
words, it aims at strict enforcement of the terms<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> of lease, while inclined
to construe genuinely doubtful points or mistakes in favour<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> of
the party bound. That landlord and tenant, even in cases of fixed
money rent, have a certain community<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> of interest, seems recognized
in the fact that some legal remedies against third persons (for malicious
damage etc) could in some cases be employed<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a> by either landlord
or tenant. In short, the latter is a thoroughly free and responsible
person.</p>

<p>That a tenant should be protected against disturbance<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> was a
matter of course. During the term of his lease he has a right to make
his lawful profit on the farm: the landlord is not only bound to allow
him full enjoyment (<i>frui licere</i>), but to prevent molestation by a third
party over whom he has control. Indeed the tenant farmer has in
some relations a more positive protection than the landlord himself.
Thus a person who has right of <i>usus</i> over an estate may in certain circumstances
refuse<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> to admit the <i>dominus</i>; but not the <i>colonus</i> or his staff
of slaves employed in the farm-work. Change of ownership can perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
never be a matter of indifference to the sitting tenant of a farm. But it is
the lawyer’s aim to see that the passing of the property shall not impair
the tenant’s rights under his current lease. A lease sometimes contained
clauses fixing the terms (such as a money forfeit)<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> on which the contract
might be broken; in fact a cross-guarantee between the parties, securing
the tenant against damage by premature ejectment and the landlord
against damage by the tenant’s premature quitting. The jurists often
appeal to local custom as a means of equitable decision on disputed
points. But one customary principle seems to be recognized<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> as of
general validity, the rule of <i>reconductio</i>. If, on expiration of a lease,
the tenant holds on and the landlord allows him to remain, it is regarded
as a renewal of the contract by bare agreement (<i>nudo consensu</i>). No
set form of lease is necessary; but this tacit contract holds good only
from year to year. Another fact significant as to the position of the
<i>colonus</i> is that he is assumed to have the right to sublet<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> the farm:
questions that would in that case arise are dealt with as matters of
course. I suppose that a lease might be so drawn as to bar any such
right, but that in practice it was always or generally admitted. Again,
it is a sign of his genuinely independent position in the eye of the law
that his own oath, if required of him, may be accepted<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> as a counter-active
plea (<i>exceptio iurisiurandi</i>) in his own defence, when sued by
his landlord for damage done on the farm.</p>

<p>On the economic side we have first to remark that the <i>colonus</i> is
represented as normally a man of small means. It is true that in the
Digest <i>conductor</i> and <i>colonus</i> are not clearly<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> distinguished, as we find
them in the African inscriptions and in the later law. For the former
is simply the counterpart of <i>locator</i>, properly connoting the relation
between the contracting parties: <i>colonus</i> expresses the fact that the
cultivation (<i>colere</i>) of land belonging to another devolves upon him by
virtue of the contract. Every <i>colonus</i> is a <i>conductor</i>, but not every
<i>conductor</i> a <i>colonus</i>. Now custom, recognized by the lawyers, provided
a means of supplying the small man’s need of capital. To set him up
in a farm, the landlord equipped him with a certain stock (<i>instrumentum</i>).
This he took over at a valuation, not paying ready money for it, but
accepting liability<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> to account for the value at the end of his tenancy.
The stock or plant included<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a> implements and animals (oxen, slaves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
etc), and a miscellaneous array of things, of course varying with the
nature of the farm and local custom. To this nucleus he had inevitably
to add belongings<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> of his own, which were likely to increase with time
if the farm prospered in his hands. His rent<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> might be either a fixed
yearly payment in cash or produce, or a proportionate share of produce
varying from year to year. The money-rent<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> seems to have been the
usual plan, and it was in connexion therewith that claims for abatement
generally arose. The impression left by the frequent references
to <i>reliqua</i> in the Digest, and the experiences of the younger Pliny, is
that tenant-farmers in Italy were habitually behind with their rents
and claiming<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> <i>remissio</i>. This is probably true of the period (say) 100-250
<span class="allsmcap">AD</span>, with which we are here concerned. It was probably a time of
great difficulty for both landlords and tenants, at least outside the
range of suburban market-gardening. Signs are not lacking that want
of sufficient capital<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> cramped the vigour of agriculture directly and
indirectly. Improvements might so raise the standard of cultivation on
an estate as to leave an awkward problem for the owner. Its upkeep on
its present level might need a large capital; tenants of means were not
easy to find, and subdivision into smaller holdings would not in all
circumstances provide a satisfactory solution. Moreover, if the man of
means was not unlikely to act independently, in defiance of the landlord,
the small man was more likely to take opportunities of misappropriating
things to which he was not entitled.</p>

<p>All these difficulties, and others, suggest no great prosperity in
Italian agriculture of the period. That on certain soils farming did
not pay, was as well known<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a> to the jurists as to other writers. And
one great cause of agricultural decline appears in their incidental
remarks as clearly as in literature. It was the devotion of much of the
best land in the best situations to the unproductive parks and pleasure-grounds
of the rich. This can hardly be laid to the account of the still
favoured financial position of Italy as compared with the Provinces,
for we find the same state of things existing late in the fourth century,
when Italy had long been provincialized and taxed accordingly. It
was fashion, and fashion of long standing, that caused this evil. And
this cause was itself an effect of the conditions of investment. The
syndicates for exploiting provincial dues had gone with the Republic.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
State contracts and industrial enterprises were not enough to employ
all the available capital. The ownership of land, now that politics
were not a school of ambition, was more than ever the chief source of
social importance. A man who could afford to own vast unremunerative
estates was a great personage. We may add that such estates, being
unremunerative, were less likely to attract the fatal attention of bad
emperors, while good rulers deliberately encouraged rich men to invest
fortunes in them as being an evidence of loyalty to the government.
The uneconomic rural conditions thus created are plainly referred to
in the staid remarks of the jurists. We read of estates owned for
pleasure (<i>voluptaria praedia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a>:
    of cases where it may be doubted<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a>
whether the <i>fundus</i> does not rather belong to the <i>villa</i> than the <i>villa</i>
to the <i>fundus</i>: and the use of the word <i>praetorium</i><a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> (= great mansion,
palace, ‘Court’) for the lord’s headquarters on his demesne becomes
almost official in the mouth of lawyers. Meanwhile great estates abroad
could be, and were, profitable to their owners, who drew rent from
tenants and were normally non-resident. Yet <i>praetoria</i> were sometimes
found even in the Provinces.</p>

<p>In connexion with this topic it is natural to consider the questions
of upkeep and improvements. The former is simple. As the tenant
has the disposal of the crops raised and gathered (<i>fructus</i>), he is
bound<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> to till the soil, to keep up the stock of plants, and to see
that the drainage of the farm is in working order. Further detail
is unnecessary, as his liability must be gauged by the state of
the farm when he took it over. Improvements look to the future.
From the lawyers we get only the legal point of view, which is of
some interest as proving that the subject was of sufficient importance
not to be overlooked. Now it seems certain that a <i>conductor</i> or <i>colonus</i>
had a right of action to recover<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> from the <i>dominus</i> not only compensation
for unexhausted improvements, but his whole outlay on them,
if shewn to have been beneficial. Or his claim might rest on the fact
that the project had been approved<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> by the landlord. But it might
happen that a work beneficial to the particular estate was detrimental
to a neighbouring one. In such a case, against whom—landlord or
tenant—had the owner of that estate a legal remedy? It was held that,
if the tenant had carried out the work in question<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> without his landlord’s
knowledge, he alone was liable. If, as some held, the landlord
was bound to provide a particular remedy, he could recover the
amount paid under this head from his tenant. To insure the owner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
against loss from the acts of his lessee was evidently an object of the
first importance, and this is in harmony with the Roman lawyers’
intense respect for rights of property. The general impression left on
the reader of their utterances on this subject is that a landlord, after
providing a considerable <i>instrumentum</i>, had done all that could
reasonably be expected from him. Improvements, the desirability of
which was usually discovered through the tenant’s experience, were
normally regarded as the tenant’s business: it was only necessary to
prevent the landlord from arbitrarily confiscating what the tenant had
done to improve his property. Obviously such ‘improvements’ were
likely to occasion disputes as to the value of the work done: but it
was the custom of the countryside to refer technical questions of this
kind to the arbitration of an impartial umpire (<i>vir bonus</i>), no doubt
a neighbour familiar with local circumstances. On the whole, it does
not appear that the law treated the <i>colonus</i> badly under this head, and
the difficulty of securing good tenants may be supposed to have
guaranteed him against unfair administration.</p>

<p>A great many more details illustrating the position of <i>coloni</i> as
they appear in the Digest could be added here, but I think the above
will be found ample for my purpose. The next topic to be dealt with
is that of labour, so far as the references of the lawyers give us any
information. First it is to be noted that the two systems<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> of estate-management,
that of cultivation for landlord’s account by his <i>actor</i> or
<i>vilicus</i>, and that of letting to tenant farmers, were existing side by
side. The latter plan was to all appearance more commonly followed
than it would seem to have been in the time of Columella, but the
former was still working. A confident opinion as to the comparative
frequency<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> of the two systems is hardly to be formed on Digest evidence:
for in rustic matters the interest of lawyers was almost solely
concerned with the relations of landlord and tenant. What an owner
did with his own property on his own account was almost entirely his
own business. There are signs that a certain change in the traditional
nomenclature represents a real change of function in the case of landlords’
managers. The term <i>actor</i> is superseding<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> <i>vilicus</i>, but the <i>vilicus</i>
still remains. He would seem to be now more of a mere farm-bailiff,
charged with the cultivation of some part or parts of an estate that
are not let to tenants. It may even be that he is left with a free hand
and only required to pay a fixed<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> yearly return. If so, this arrangement
is not easily to be distinguished from the case of a slave <i>colonus</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
or <i>quasi colonus</i><a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> occupying a farm. The financial and general supervision
of the estate is in the hands of the <i>actor</i><a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a>, who collects all dues,
including rents of <i>colonie</i> and is held to full account<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> for all these
receipts as well as for the contents of the store-rooms. He is a slave,
but a valuable and trusted man: it is significant that the manumission<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a>
of <i>actores</i> is not seldom mentioned. Evidently the qualities
looked for in such an agent were observed to develope most readily
under a prospect of freedom. But, so long as he remained <i>actor</i> of an
estate, he could be regarded as part of it: in a bequest the testator
could include him as a part<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>, and often did so: and indeed his peculiar
knowledge of local detail must often have been an important element
in its value. To employ such a person in the management of an estate,
with powerful inducements to good conduct, may have solved many a
difficult problem. We may perhaps guess that it made the employment
of a qualified legal agent (<i>procurator</i>) less often necessary, at
least if the <i>actor</i> contrived to avoid friction with his master’s free
tenants.</p>

<p>Whether an estate was farmed for the owner by his manager, or
let to tenants, or partly on one system partly on the other, it is clear
that slave-labour is assumed as the normal basis of working. For the
<i>colonus</i> takes over slaves supplied by the <i>dominus</i> as an item of the
<i>instrumentum</i>. And there was nothing to prevent him from adding
slaves of his own, if he could afford it and thought it worth his while
to employ a larger staff. Whether such additions were often or ever
made, we must not expect the lawyers to tell us; but we do now and
then hear<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> of a slave who is the tenant’s own. Such a slave might as
part of the tenant’s goods be pledged to the landlord as security for
his rent, but he would not be a part of the estate of which the landlord
could dispose by sale or bequest. In such a case the slaves might be
regarded<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> as accessories of the <i>fundus</i>, if it were so agreed. This raised
questions as to the degree of connexion that should be treated as
qualifying a slave to be considered an appurtenance of a farm. The
answer was in effect that he must be a member of the regular staff.
Mere temporary employment on the place did not so attach him, mere
temporary absence on duty elsewhere did not detach him. A further
question was whether all slaves in any sort of employment on the
place were included, or only such as were actually engaged in farm
work proper, cultivation of the soil, not those employed in various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
subsidiary<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> industries. These questions the jurists discussed fully, but
we cannot follow them here, as their legal importance is chiefly in
connexion with property and can hardly have affected seriously the
position of tenants. But it is interesting to observe that the lawyers
were feeling the necessity of attempting some practical classification.
The distinction<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> between <i>urbana</i> and <i>rustica mancipia</i> was old enough as
a loose conversational or literary one. But, when rights of inheritance
or legacy of such valuable property were involved, it became important
to define (if possible) the essential characteristics of a ‘rustic’ slave.</p>

<p>That the condition of the rustic slave was improving, and generally
far better than it had been on the <i>latifundia</i> of Republican days, seems
indicated by the jurists’ speaking of a slave as <i>colonus</i> or <i>quasi colonus</i>
without any suggestion of strangeness in the relation. We may
assume that only slaves of exceptional capacity and merit would be
placed in a position of economic (if not legal) equality with free tenants.
Still the growth of such a custom can hardly have been without some
effect on the condition of rustic slaves in general. It was not new in
the second century: it is referred to by a jurist<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> of the Augustan age.
The increasing difficulty of getting either good tenants or good slaves
no doubt induced landlords to entrust farms to men who could and
would work them profitably, whether freemen or slaves. And a slave
had in agriculture, as in trades and finance, a point in his favour: his
person and his goods<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> remained in his master’s power. If by skilled
and honest management he relieved his master of trouble and worry,
and contributed by regular payment of rent to assure his income, it
was reasonable to look for gratitude expressed, on the usual Roman
lines, in his master’s will. Manumission, perhaps accompanied by
bequest<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> of the very farm that he had worked so well, was a probable
reward. May we not guess that some of the best farming carried on
in Italy under the earlier Empire was achieved by trusted slaves, in
whom servile apathy was overcome by hope? Such a farmer-slave
would surely have under him<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> slave labourers, the property of his
master; and he would have the strongest possible motives for tact
and skill in their management, while his own capacity had been developed
by practical experience. I can point to no arrangement in
Roman agriculture so calculated to make it efficient on a basis of
slavery as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span></p>

<p>The services (<i>operae</i>) of a slave, due to his owner or to some one in
place of his owner, were a property capable of valuation, and therefore
could be let and hired at a price. That is, the person to whom they
were due could commute<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> them for a <i>merces</i>. This might, as in the
corresponding Greek case of ἀποφορά, be a paying business, if a slave
had been bought cheap and trained so as to earn good wages. It was
common enough in various trades: what concerns us is that the plan
was evidently in use in the rustic world also. Now this is notable.
We naturally ask, if the man’s services were worth so much to the
hirer, why should they not have been worth as much (or even a little
more) to his own master? Why should it pay to let him rather than
to use him yourself? Of course the owner might have more slaves
than he needed at the moment: or the hirer might be led by temporary
need of labour to offer a fancy price for the accommodation: or
two masters on neighbouring farms might engage in a reciprocity of
cross-hirings to suit their mutual convenience at certain seasons. Further
possibilities might be suggested, but are such occasional explanations
sufficient to account for the prevalence of this hiring-system?
I think not. Surely the principal influence, steadily operating in this
direction, was one that implied an admission of the economic failure
of slavery. If A’s slave worked for B so well that it paid A to let him
do so and to receive a rent for his services, it follows that the slave had
some inducement to exert his powers more fully as B’s hireling than
in the course of ordinary duty under his own master. Either the nature
and conditions of the work under B were pleasanter, or he received
something for himself over and above the stipulated sum claimed by
his master. In other words, as a mere slave he did not do his best:
as a hired man he felt some of the stimulus that a free man gets from
the prospect of his wage. So Slavery, already philanthropically questioned,
was in this confession economically condemned.</p>

<p>These points considered, we are not surprised to find mention of
slaves letting out their own<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> <i>operae</i>. This must imply the consent of
their masters, and it is perhaps not rash to see in such a situation a
sign of weakening in the effective authority of masters. A master
whose interest is bound up with the fullest development of his slave’s
powers (as rentable property exposed to competition) will hardly act
the martinet without forecasting the possible damage to his own
pocket. A slave who knows that his master draws an income from
his efficiency is in a strong position for gradually extorting privileges
till he attains no small degree of independence. We may perhaps find
traces of such an advance in the arrangement by which a slave hires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
his own <i>operae</i><a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> from his master. He will thus make a profit out of
hiring himself: in fact he is openly declaring that he will not work at
full power for his master, but only compound with him for output on
the scale of an ordinary slave. This arrangement was common in arts
and handicrafts, and not specially characteristic of Rome. In rustic
life, the slave put into a farm as tenant<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> at a fixed rent, and taking
profit and loss, may furnish an instance. Whether such cases were
frequent we do not know. The general impression left by the Digest
passages on hiring and letting of slaves is that, when we read of
<i>mercennarii</i>, it is generally if not always hireling<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a> slaves, not free
wage-earners, that are meant. In a passage<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a> where <i>servus</i> occurs as
well as <i>mercennarius</i>, it is reference to the owner as well as to the
hirer that necessitates the addition. If I have interpreted these points
aright, the picture suggested is a state of things in which the rustic
slave was steadily improving his position, supplying hired labour, at
times entrusted with the charge of a farm, and with a fair prospect of
becoming by manumission under his owner’s will a free <i>colonus</i>, or even
his own landlord. How far this picture is really characteristic of rustic
Italy, or of the Provinces (such as Gaul or Spain), is what one would
like to know, but I can find no evidence.</p>

<p>In the foregoing paragraphs I have refrained from inquiring
whether the <i>colonus</i> as he appears in the Digest was a farmer who
worked with his own hands, or merely an employer and director of
labour. The reason is that I have found in the texts no evidence
whatever on the point. It was not the jurist’s business. We are left to
guess at the truth as best we may, and we can only start from consideration
of the farmer’s own interest, and assume that the average
farmer knew his own interest and was guided thereby. Now, being
bound to pay rent in some form or other and to make good any
deficiencies in the <i>instrumentum</i> at the end of his tenancy, he had
every inducement to get all he could out of the land while he held it.
How best to do this, was his problem. And the answer no doubt
varied according to the size of the farm, the kind of crops that could
profitably be raised there, and the number and quality of the staff. In
some rough operations, his constant presence on one spot and sharing
the actual work might get the most out of his men. Where nicety of
skill was the main thing, he might better spend his time in direction
and minute watching of the hands. On a fairly large farm he would
have enough to do as director. We may reasonably guess that he only
toiled with his own hands if he thought it would pay him to do so.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
This <i>a priori</i> guesswork is not satisfactory. But I see nothing else to
be said; for the African inscriptions do not help us. The circumstances
of those great domains were exceptional.</p>

<p>So far we have been viewing agriculture as proceeding in times and
under conditions assumed to be more or less normal, without taking
account of the various disturbing elements in rustic life, by which both
landlords and tenants were liable to suffer vexation and loss. Yet these
were not a few. Even a lawyer could not ignore wild beasts. Wolves
carried off some of A’s pigs. Dogs kept by B, <i>colonus</i> of a neighbouring
<i>villa</i>, for protection of his own flocks, rescued the pigs. A legal question<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>
at once arises: are the rescued pigs regarded as wild game, and
therefore belonging to the owner of the dogs? No, says the jurist.
They were still within reach; A had not given them up for lost; if B
tries to retain them, the law provides remedies to make him give them
up. I presume that B would have a claim to some reward for his services.
But the lawyer is silent, confining his opinion to the one question
of property. References to depredations of robbers or brigands (<i>latrones</i>,
<i>grassatores</i>,) occur often, and quite as a matter of course. The police of
rural Italy, not to mention the Provinces, was an old scandal. Stock-thieves,
who lifted a farmer’s cattle sheep or goats, and sometimes his
crops, were important enough to have a descriptive name (<i>abigei</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> and
a title of the Digest to themselves. That bad neighbours made themselves
unpleasant in many ways, and that their presence gave a bad
name to properties near them, was an experience of all lands and all
ages: but the jurists treat it gravely<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> as a lawyer’s matter. Concealment
of such a detrimental fact<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> by the seller of an estate made the
sale voidable. The rich (old offenders in this kind) were by a rescript
of Hadrian<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> awarded differential punishment for removing landmarks:
in their case the purpose of encroachment was not a matter open to
doubt.</p>

<p>In one connexion the use of force as an embarrassing feature of
rustic life was a subject of peculiar interest to the jurists, and had long
been so. This was in relation to questions of possession. In Roman
law <i>possessio</i> held a very important place. All that need be said of it
here is that the fact of possession, or lack of it, seriously affected the
position of litigants in disputes as to property. Great ingenuity was
exercised in definition and in laying down rules for ascertaining the
fact. Now among the means employed in gaining or recovering possession
none was more striking or more effective than the use of force.
Special legal remedies had been provided to deal with such violence;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
<i>interdicta</i> issued by the praetor, to forbid it, or to reinstate a claimant
dislodged by his rival, or simply to state the exact issue raised in a
particular case. On conformity or disobedience to the praetor’s order
the case was formally tried in court: the question of law mainly turned
on questions of fact. What concerns us is that force was solemnly
classified under two heads, <i>vis</i> and <i>vis armata</i>. Each of these had its
own proper interdict at least as early as the time of Cicero, and they
occupy a whole title<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> in the Digest. Clearly the use of force was no
negligible matter. That it was a danger or at least a nuisance to
owners or claimants of <em class="gesperrt">property</em>, is not less clear. But how did it touch
the <i>colonus</i>? He was, as such, neither owner nor claimant of the property
of his farm. He had in his own capacity<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> no <em class="gesperrt">possession</em> either. But, as
tenant of a particular owner, his presence operated<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a> to secure the possession
of his landlord. Hence to oust him by force broke the landlord’s
possession; whether rightly or wrongly, the law had to decide. Now
it is obvious that, in cases where serious affrays resulted from intrusion,
a tenant might suffer grave damage to his goods and person. The
intruders (often a gang of slaves) would seldom be so punctiliously
gentle as to do no harm at all. Therefore, having regard to the amount
of interest in this subject shewn by the lawyers, we cannot omit the
use of force in matters of possession from the list of rustic embarrassments.</p>

<p>Another cause of annoyance was connected with servitudes, such
as rights of way and water, which were frequent subjects of dispute in
country districts. Whether regarded as rights or as burdens, the principles
governing them were a topic that engaged the minute and
laborious attention<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> of the lawyers. Now it is evident that a right of
way or water through an estate, though a material advantage to a
neighbouring estate served by the convenience, might be a material
disadvantage to the one over which the right extended. Also that the
annoyance might be indefinitely increased or lessened by the cantankerous
or considerate user of the right by the person or persons enjoying
it. When we consider that servitudes were already an important department
of jurisprudence in Republican days, and see how great a
space they occupy in the Digest, we can hardly resist the conclusion
that country proprietors found in them a fertile subject of quarrels.
But surely the quarrels of landlords over a matter of this kind could
not be carried on without occasional and perhaps frequent disturbances
and injury to the tenants on the land. Even if the law provided means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
of getting compensation for any damage done to a tenant’s crops or
other goods in the course of attempts to enforce or defeat a claimed
servitude, was the average <i>colonus</i> a man readily to seek compensation
in the law-courts? I think not. But, if not, he would depend solely on
the goodwill of his own landlord, supposing the latter to have got the
upper hand in the main dispute. On the whole, I strongly suspect that
in practice these quarrels over rustic servitudes were a greater nuisance
to farmers than might be supposed. So far as I know, we have no
statement of the farmer’s point of view. Another intermittent but
damaging occurrence was the occasional passage of soldiery, whose
discipline was often lax. We might easily forget the depredations and
general misconduct of these unruly ruffians, and imagine that such
annoyances only became noticeable in a later period. But the jurists
do not allow us to forget<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> the military requisitions for supply of troops
on the march, the payment for which is not clearly provided, and
would at best be a cause of trouble; or the pilferings of the men,
compensation for which was probably not to be had. It would be
farmers in northern Italy and the frontier-provinces that were the
chief sufferers.</p>

<p>Damage by natural disturbances or by fires may happen in any age
or country. That Italy in particular was exposed to the effect of floods
and earthquakes, we know. Accordingly the lawyers are seriously concerned
with the legal and equitable questions arising out of such events.
It was not merely the claim of tenants<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a> to abatement of rent that called
for a statement of principles. Beside the sudden effects of earthquakes
torrents or fires, there were the slower processes of streams changing
their courses<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> and gradual land-slides on the slopes of hills. These
movements generally affected the proprietary relations of neighbouring
landlords, taking away land from one, sometimes giving to another.
Here was a fine opening for ingenious jurists, of which they took full
advantage. The growth of estates by alluvion, and loss by erosion, was
a favourite topic, the operation of which, and the questions thereby
raised, are so earnestly treated as to shew their great importance in
country life. Of fire-damage, due to malice or neglect, no more need
be said; nor of many other minor matters.</p>

<p>But, when all the above drawbacks have been allowed for, it is still
probably true that scarcity of labour was a far greater difficulty for
farmers. We hear very little directly of this trouble, as it raised no point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
of law. Very significant<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> however are the attempts of the Senate and
certain emperors to put down an inveterate scandal which is surely
good indirect evidence of the scarcity. It consisted in the harbouring<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a>
of runaway slaves on the estates of other landlords. A runaway from
one estate was of course not protected and fed on another estate from
motives of philanthropy. The slave would be well aware that severe
punishment awaited him if recovered by his owner, and therefore be
willing to work for a new master who might, if displeased, surrender
him any day. The landlords guilty of this treason to the interests of their
class were probably the same as those who harboured<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> brigands, another
practice injurious to peaceful agriculture both in Italy and abroad.
Another inconvenience, affecting all trades and all parts of the empire
in various degrees, was the local difference in the money-value<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> of commodities
in different markets. This was sometimes great: and that it
was troublesome to farmers may be inferred from the particular mention
of wine oil and corn as cases in point. No doubt dealers had the
advantage over producers, as they generally have, through possessing a
more than local knowledge of necessary facts. These middlemen however
could not be dispensed with, as experience shewed, and one of the later
jurists<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> openly recognized. Facilities for borrowing, and rates of interest,
varied greatly in various centres. But all these market questions do
not seem to have been so acute as to be a public danger until the
ruinous debasement of the currency in the time of Gallienus. A few
references may be found to peculiar usages of country life in particular
Provinces. Thus we read that in Arabia<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> farms were sometimes ‘boycotted,’
any person cultivating such a farm being threatened with
assassination. In Egypt<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> special care had to be taken to protect the
dykes regulating the distribution of Nile water. Both these offences
were summarily dealt with by the provincial governor, and the penalty
was death. Here we have one more proof of the anxiety of the imperial
government to insure the greatest possible production of food. The
empire was always hungry,—and so were the barbarians. And the
northern frontier provinces could not feed both themselves and the
armies.</p>

<p>While speaking of landlords and tenants we must not forget that
all over the empire considerable areas of land were owned by municipalities,
and dealt with at the discretion of the local authorities. Variety
of systems was no doubt dictated by variety of local circumstances:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
but one characteristic was so general as to deserve special attention on
the part of jurists. This was the system of perpetual leaseholds<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> at
a fixed (and undoubtedly beneficial) rent, heritable and transferable
to assigns. So long as the tenant regularly paid the <i>vectigal</i>, his occupation
was not to be disturbed. It was evidently the desire of the
municipal authorities to have a certain income to reckon with: for the
sake of certainty they would put up with something less than a rack-rent.
There were also other lands owned by these <i>civitates</i> that
were let on the system<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> in use by private landlords; the normal
term probably being five years. Of these no more need be said here.
Beneficial leases under a municipality were liable to corrupt management.
It had been found necessary<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> to disqualify members of the local
Senate (<i>decuriones</i>) from holding such leases, that they might not share
out the common lands among themselves on beneficial terms. But this
prohibition was not enough. The town worthies put in men of straw<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a>
as nominal tenants, through whom they enjoyed the benefits of the
leases. So this evasion also had to be met by revoking the ill-gotten
privilege. But disturbance of tenancies was not to be lightly allowed,
so it appears that a reference to the emperor<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a> was necessary before such
revocation could take place. This system of perpetual leases is of
interest, not as indicating different methods of cultivation from those
practised on private estates, but as betraying a tendency to fixity<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> already
existing, destined to spread and to take other forms, and to
become the fatal characteristic of the later Empire. Another striking
piece of evidence in the same direction occurs in connexion with the
lessees (<i>publicani</i>) of various state dues (<i>vectigalia publica</i>) farmed out
in the usual way. In the first half of the third century the jurist Paulus
attests<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> the fact that, in case it was found that the right of collecting
such dues, hitherto very profitable to the lessees, could only be let at a
lower lump sum than hitherto, the old lessees were held bound to continue
their contract at the old price. But Callistratus, contemporary or
nearly so, tells us that this was not so, and quotes<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> a rescript of Hadrian
(117-138 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>) condemning the practice as tyrannical and likely to deter
men from entering into so treacherous a bargain. It appears that other<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
emperors had forbidden it, but there is no proof that they succeeded in
stopping it. At all events the resort to coercion in a matter of contract
like this reveals the presence of a belief in compulsory fixity, ominous
of the coming imperial paralysis, though of course not so understood
at the time. It did not directly affect agriculture as yet; but its application
to agriculture was destined to be a symptom and a cause of the
empire’s decline and fall.</p>

<p>Another group of tenancies, the number and importance of which
was quietly increasing, was that known as <i>praedia Caesaris</i><a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a>, <i>fundi
fiscales</i>, and so forth. We need not discuss the departmental differences
and various names of these estates. The tenants, whether small men
or <i>conductores</i> on a large scale who sublet in parcels<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> to <i>coloni</i>, held
either directly or indirectly from the emperor. We have seen specimens
in Africa, the Province in which the crown-properties were exceptionally
large. What chiefly concerns us here is the imperial land-policy.
It seems clear that its first aim was to keep these estates permanently
occupied by good solvent tenants. The surest means to this end was
to give these estates a good name, to create a general impression that
on imperial farms a man had a better chance of thriving than on those
of average private landlords. Now the ‘state,’ that is the emperor or
his departmental chiefs, could favour crown-tenants in various ways
without making a material sacrifice of a financial kind. In particular,
the treatment of crown-estates as what we call ‘peculiars,’ in which
local disputes were settled, not by resort to the courts of ordinary law,
but administratively<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> by the emperor’s <i>procuratores</i>, was probably a
great relief; above all to the humbler <i>coloni</i>, whom we may surely
assume to have been a class averse to litigation. No doubt a <i>procurator</i>
might be corrupted and unjust. But he was probably far more effectually
watched than ordinary magistrates; and, if the worst came to
the worst, there was as we have seen the hope of a successful appeal
to the emperor. Another favour consisted in the exemption of Caesar’s
tenants from various burdensome official duties in municipalities, the
so-called <i>munera</i>, which often entailed great expense. This is mentioned
by a jurist<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> near the end of the second century: they are only to perform
such duties so far as not to cause loss to the treasury. Another<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a>,
somewhat later, says that their exemption is granted in order that
they may be more suitable tenants of treasury-farms. This exemption
is one more evidence of the well-known fact that in this age municipal
offices were beginning to be evaded<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a> as ruinous, and no longer sought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
as an honour. We must note that, if this <i>immunitas</i> relieved the crown-tenants,
it left all the more burdens to be borne by those who enjoyed no
such relief. And this cannot have been good for agriculture in general.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the <i>fiscus</i><a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a> was a slack and easy landlord.
Goods of debtors were promptly seized to cover liabilities: attempts
to evade payment of <i>tributa</i> by a private agreement<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a> between mortgagor
and mortgagee were quashed: a rescript<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a> of Marcus and Verus insisted
on the treasury share (½) of treasure trove: and so on. But there are
signs of a reasonable and considerate policy, in not pressing demands
so as to inflict hardship. Trajan<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> had set a good example, and good
emperors followed it. We may fairly guess that this moderation in
financial dealings was not wholly laid aside in the management of
imperial estates. Nor is it to be imagined that the advantages of imperial
tenants were exactly the same in all parts of the empire. In
Provinces through which armies had to move it is probable that <i>coloni
Caesaris</i> would suffer less<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> than ordinary farmers from military annoyances.
But on the routes to and from a seat of war it is obvious that
the imperial post-service would be subjected to exceptional strain.
Now this service was at the best of times<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> a cause of vexations and
losses to the farmers along the line of traffic. The staff made good all
deficiencies in their requirements by taking beasts fodder vehicles etc
wherever they could find them: what they restored was much the
worse for wear, and compensation, if ever got, was tardy and inadequate.
The repair of roads was another pretext for exaction. It is hardly to
be doubted that in these respects imperial tenants suffered less than
others. Some emperors<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> took steps to ease the burden, which had been
found too oppressive to the roadside estates. But this seems to have
been no more than relief from official requisitions: irregular ‘commandeering’
was the worst evil, and we have no reason to think that it
was effectually suppressed. It appears in the next period as a rampant
abuse, vainly forbidden by the laws of the Theodosian code.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_L">L. THE LATER COLONATE, ITS PLACE IN ROMAN HISTORY.</h3>

<p>In the endeavour to extract from scattered and fragmentary evidence
some notion of agricultural conditions in the Roman empire before
and after Diocletian we are left with two imperfect pictures, so strongly
contrasted as to suggest a suspicion of their truth. We can hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
believe that the system known as the later Colonate appeared in full
force as a sudden phenomenon. Nor indeed are we compelled to fly
so directly in the face of historical experience. That we have no narrative
of the steps that led to this momentous change, is surely due to
the inability of contemporaries to discern the future effect of tendencies
operating silently<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> and piecemeal. What seems at the moment insignificant,
even if observed, is seldom recorded, and very seldom intentionally.
Hence after generations, seeking to trace effects to causes, are
puzzled by defects of record. Their only resource is to supplement,
so far as possible, defective record by general consideration of the
history of the time in question and cautious inference therefrom: in
fact to get at the true meaning of fragmentary admissions in relation
to their historical setting. The chief topic to be dealt with here from
this point of view is the character of the Roman Empire in several
aspects. For among all the anxieties of the government during these
troubled centuries the one that never ceased was the fear of failure in
supplies of food.</p>

<p>The character of the Roman Empire had been largely determined
by the fact that it arose from the overthrow of a government that had
long been practically aristocratic. The popular movements that contributed
to this result only revealed the impossibility of establishing
anything like a democracy, and the unreality of any power save the
power of the sword. The great dissembler Augustus concealed a virtual
autocracy by conciliatory handling of the remains of the nobility. But
the Senate, to which he left or gave many powers, was never capable
of bearing a vital part in the administration, and its influence continued
to dwindle under his successors. The master of the army was the
master of the empire, and influence was more and more vested in those
who were able to guide his policy. That these might be, and sometimes
were, not born Romans at all, but imperial freedmen generally of Greek
or mixed-Greek origin, was a very significant fact. In particular, it
marked and encouraged the growth of departmental bureaus, permanent
and efficient beyond the standard of previous Roman experience.
But the price of this efficiency was centralization, a condition that
carried with it inevitable dangers, owing to the vast extent of the
empire. In modern times the fashionable remedy suggested for over-centralization
is devolution of powers to local governments controlling
areas of considerable size. Or, in cases of aggregation, the existing
powers left to states merged in a confederation are considerable. In
any case, the subordinate units are free to act within their several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
limited spheres, and the central government respects their ‘autonomy,’
only interfering in emergencies to enforce the fulfilment of definite
common obligations.</p>

<p>But, if it had been desired to gain any such relief by a system of
devolution within the Roman empire, this would have meant the recognition
of ‘autonomy’ in the Provinces. And this was inconceivable.
The extension of Roman dominion had been achieved by dividing
Rome’s adversaries. Once conquered, it was the interest or policy of
the central power to keep them in hand by preventing the growth of
self-conscious cohesion in the several units. Each Province was, as the
word implied, a department of the Roman system, ruled by a succession
of Roman governors. It looked to Rome for orders, for redress of
grievances, for protection at need. If the advance of Rome destroyed
no true nations, her government at least made the development of
truly national characteristics impossible, while she herself formed no
Roman nation. Thus, for better or worse, the empire was <em class="gesperrt">non-national</em>.
But, as we have already seen, the decline of Italy made it more and
more clear that the strength of the empire lay in the Provinces. Now,
having no share in initiative and no responsibility, the Provinces steadily
lost vitality under Roman civilization, and became more and more
helplessly dependent on the central power. As the strain on the empire
became greater, the possibility of relief by devolution grew less:
but more centralization was no cure for what was already a disease.</p>

<p>That local government of a kind existed in the empire is true
enough; also that it was one of the most striking and important
features of the system. But it was municipal, and tended rather to
subdivide than to unite. It was the outcome of a civilization profoundly
urban in its origins and ideas. The notion that a city was a state was by
no means confined to the independent cities of early Greece. Whether
it voluntarily merged itself in a League or lived on as a subordinate
unit in the system of a dominant power, the city and its territory were
politically one. Within their several boundaries the townsmen and
rustic citizens of each city were subject to the authorities of that
community. Beyond their own boundary they were aliens under the
authorities of another city. It is no wonder that jealousies between
neighbour cities were often extreme, and that Roman intervention was
often needed to keep the peace between rivals. But the system suited
Roman policy. In the East and wherever cities existed they were
taken over as administrative units and as convenient centres of taxation:
in the West it was found useful and practicable to introduce
urban centres into tribes and cantons, and even in certain districts to
attach<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a> local populations to existing cities as dependent hamlets. And,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
so long as the imperial government was able to guard the frontiers and
avert the shock of disturbances of the Roman peace, the empire held
its own in apparent prosperity. To some historians the period of the
‘Antonines’ (say about 100-170 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>) has seemed a sort of Golden Age.
But signs are not lacking that the municipal system had seen its best
days. The severe strain on imperial resources in the time of Marcus
left behind it general exhaustion. The decay of local patriotism marked
the pressure of poverty and loss of vitality in the cities. More and
more their importance became that of mere taxation-centres, in which
the evasion of duty was the chief preoccupation: they could not reinvigorate
the empire, nor the empire them.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of the empire, not less significant than those
mentioned above, was this: taken as a whole, it was <em class="gesperrt">non-industrial</em>.
Manufactures existed here and there, and products of various kinds
were exchanged between various parts of the empire. So far as the
ordinary population was concerned, the Roman world might well have
supplied its own needs. But this was not enough. The armies, though
perilously small for the work they had to do, were a heavy burden.
The imperial civil service as it became more elaborate did not become
less costly. The waste of resources on unremunerative buildings and
shows in cities, above all in Rome, and the ceaseless expense of feeding
a worthless rabble, were a serious drain: ordained by established custom,
maintained by vanity, to economize on these follies would seem a confession
of weakness. Nor should the extravagance of the rich, and of
many emperors, be forgotten: this created a demand for luxuries chiefly
imported from the East; precious stones, delicate fabrics, spices, perfumes,
rare woods, ivory, and so forth. Rome had no goods to export
in payment for such things, and the scarcity of return-cargoes must
have added heavily to the cost of carriage. There was on this account
a steady drain of specie to the East, and this had to be met by a
corresponding drain of specie to Rome. In one form or another this
meant money drawn from the Provinces, for which the Provinces received
hardly the bare pretence of an equivalent, or a better security
for peace.</p>

<p>Thus the empire, created by conquest and absorption, administered
by bureaucratic centralization, <em class="gesperrt">rested on force</em>; a force partly real
and still present, partly traditional, derived from a victorious past.
The belief in Rome as the eternal city went for much, and we hear of
no misgivings as to the soundness of a civilization which expressed
itself in a constant excess of consumption over production. Naturally
enough, under such conditions, the imperial system became more and
more what it really was from the first, a vast machine. It was not a
league of cooperating units, each containing a vital principle of growth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
and furnishing the power of recovery from disaster. Its apathetic parts
looked passively to the centre for guidance or relief, depending on the
perfection of a government whose imperfection was assured by attempting
a task beyond the reach of human faculty and virtue. The exposure
of the empire’s weakness came about through collision with the forces
of northern barbarism. What a machine could do, that it did, and its
final failure was due to maladies that made vain all efforts to renew
its internal strength.</p>

<p>The wars with the northern barbarians brought out with singular
clearness two important facts, already known but not sufficiently taken
into account. First, that the enemy were increasing in numbers while
the people of the empire were in most parts stationary or even declining.
Bloody victories, when gained, did practically nothing to
redress the balance. Secondly, that at the back of this embarrassing
situation lay a food-question of extreme seriousness and complexity.
More and more food was needed for the armies, and the rustics of the
empire, even when fitted for military service, could not be spared from
the farms without danger to the food-supply. The demands of the
commissariat were probably far greater than we might on the face of
it suppose; for an advance into the enemy’s territory did not ease
matters. Little or nothing was found to eat: indeed it was the pressure
of a growing population on the means of subsistence that drove the
hungry German tribes to face the Roman sword in quest of abundant
food and the wine and oil of the South and West. The attempt of
Marcus and others after him, to solve the problems of the moment by
enlisting barbarians in Roman armies, was no permanent solution.
The aliens too had to be fed, and their pay in money could not be
deferred. Meanwhile the taxation of the empire inevitably grew, and
the productive industries had to stagger along under heavier burdens.
The progressive increase of these is sufficiently illustrated in the history
of <i>indictiones</i>. At first an <i>indictio</i> was no more than an occasional<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a>
impost of so much corn levied by imperial proclamation on landed
properties in order to meet exceptional scarcity in Rome. But it was
in addition to the regular <i>tributum</i>, and was of course most likely to
occur in years when scarcity prevailed. No wonder it was already felt
onerous<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> in the time of Trajan. Pressure on imperial resources caused
it not only to become more frequent, and eventually normal: it was
extended<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> to include other products, and became a regular burden of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
almost universal application, and ended by furnishing a new chronological
unit, the Indiction-period of 15 years.</p>

<p>That agriculture, already none too prosperous, suffered heavily
under this capricious impost in the second century, seems to me a fact
beyond all doubt. And, not being then a general imperial tax, it fell
upon those provinces that were still flourishing producers of corn.
Debasement of currency already lowered the value of money-taxes,
and tempted emperors to extend the system of dues in kind. Under
Diocletian and Galerius things came to a head. Vast increase of taxation
was called for under the new system, and it was mainly <em class="gesperrt">taxation
in kind</em>. Already the failure of agriculture was notorious, and attempts
had been made to enforce cultivation of derelict lands. The new taxation
only aggravated present evils, and in despair of milder measures
Constantine attached the <i>coloni</i> to the soil. Important as the legal
foundation of the later serf-colonate, this law is historically still more
important as a recognition of past failure which nothing had availed
to check. He saw no way of preventing a general stampede from the
farms save to forbid it as illegal, and to employ the whole machinery
of the empire in enforcing the new law. This policy was only a part
of the general tendency to fix everything in a rigid framework, to make
all occupations hereditary, that became normal in the later Empire.
The Codes are a standing record of the principle that the remedy for
failure of legislation was more legislation of the same kind. Hard-pressed
emperors needed all the resources they could muster, particularly
food. They had no breathing-space to try whether more freedom
might not promote enterprise and increase production, even had such
a policy come within their view. Hence the cramping crystallizing
process went on with the certainty of fate. The government, unable
to develope existing industry, simply squeezed it to exhaustion.</p>

<p>How came it that the government was able to do this? How came
it that agricultural tenants could be converted into stationary serfs
without causing a general upheaval<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> and immediate dissolution of the
empire? Mainly, I think, because the act of Constantine was no more
than a recognition <i>de iure</i> of a condition already created <i>de facto</i> by
a long course of servilizing influences. Also because it was the apparent
interest, not only of the imperial treasury but of the great proprietors
generally, to tie down to the soil<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> the cultivators of their estates. Labour
was now more valuable than land. In corn-growing Africa the importance
attached to the task-work of sub-tenants was a confession of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
this. And, law or no law, things had to move in one or other direction.
Either the landlord and head-lessee had to win further control of the
tenants, or the tenants must become less dependent. Only the former
alternative was possible in the circumstances; and the full meaning of
the change that turned <i>de facto</i> dependence into legal constraint may
be stated as a recognition of the <i>colonus</i> as labourer rather than tenant.
Whether the settlement of barbarians as domiciled aliens in some
Provinces under strict conditions of farm-labour had anything to do
with the creation of this new semi-servile status, seems hardly to be
decided on defective evidence. At all events it cannot have hindered
it. And we must make full allowance for the effect of various conditions
in various Provinces. If we rightly suppose that the position of <i>coloni</i>
had been growing weaker for some time before the act of Constantine,
this does not imply that the process was due to the same causes
operating alike in all parts of the empire in the same degree. The
evidence of the Theodosian Code shews many local differences of phenomena
in the fourth and fifth centuries; and it is not credible that
there was a greater uniformity in the conditions of the preceding age.
Laws might aim at uniformity, but they could not alter facts.</p>

<p>My conclusion therefore is that the general character of the imperial
system was the main cause of the later serf-colonate. However much
the degradation of free farm-tenants, or the admission of slaves to
tenancies, or the settlement of barbarians under conditions of service,
may have contributed to the result, it was the mechanical nature of
the system as a whole that gave effect to them all. After Trajan the
rulers of the empire became more and more conscious that the problem
before them was one of conservation, and that extension was at an
end. Hadrian saw this, and strove to perfect the internal organization.
By the time of Aurelian it was found necessary to surrender territory
as a further measure of security. We can hardly doubt that under such
conditions the machine of internal administration operated more mechanically
than ever. Then, when the reforms of Diocletian made fresh
taxation necessary to defray their cost, an agricultural crisis was produced
by the turning of the imperial screw. The hierarchy of officials
justified their existence by squeezing an assured revenue out of a
population unable to resist but able to remove. There was no other
source of revenue to take the place of the land: moreover, it was
agricultural produce in kind that was required. Therefore the central
bureaucracy, unchecked by any public opinion, did after its wont. In
that selfish and servile world each one took care of his own skin.
Compulsion was the rule: the <i>coloni</i> must be made to produce food:
therefore they must be bound fast to the soil, or the empire would
starve—and the officials with it.</p>

<h4 id="note4">ADDITIONAL NOTES TO CHAPTER L.</h4>

<p>I cannot lose this opportunity of referring to a very interesting little book
by M. Augé-Laribé, <i>L’évolution de la France agricole</i> [Paris 1912]. Much of it
bears directly on the labour-question, and sets forth the difficulties hindering
its solution. It is peculiarly valuable to a student of the question in the
ancient world, because it lays great stress on the effect of causes arising from
modern conditions. Causes operating in both ancient and modern times are
thereby made more readily and clearly perceptible. Such modern influences
in particular as the vast development of transport, the concentration of machine-industries
in towns, and the constant attraction of better and more continuous
wage-earning, by which the rustic is drawn to urban centres, are highly significant.
The difference from ancient conditions is so great in degree that it
practically almost amounts to a difference in kind. So too in the material resources
of agriculture: the development of farm-machinery has superseded
much hand-labour, while Science has increased the possible returns from a
given portion of soil.</p>

<p>Most significant of all from my point of view is the author’s insistence on
the <i>irregularity</i> of wage-earning in rustic life as an active cause of the flitting
of wage-earners to the towns. This brings it home to a student that a system
of rustic slavery implies a set of conditions incompatible with such an economic
migration; and also that the employment of slaves by urban craftsmen would
not leave many eligible openings for immigrant rustics. It is fully consistent
with my view that the wage-earning rustic was a rare figure in the Greco-Roman
world.</p>

<p>It is perhaps in the remedies proposed by the author for present evils (and
for the resulting depopulation of the countryside) that the contrast of ancient
and modern is most clearly marked. Bureaucratic the French administrative
system may be: but it is not the expression of a despotism that enslaves its
citizens in the frantic effort to maintain itself against pressure from without.
For individuals and organizations are free to think speak and act, and so to
promote what seems likely to do good. Initiative and invention are not
deadened by the fear that betterment will only serve as a pretext for increase
of burdens. Stationary by instinct the French peasant proprietor may be: but
he is free to move if he will, and no one dare propose to tie him to the soil
by law.</p>

<p>Nor can I omit a reference to a paper of the late Prof Pelham on <i>The
Imperial domains and the Colonate</i> (1890, in volume of Essays, Oxford 1911).</p>

<p>The simplicity of the solution there offered is most attractive, and the
general value of the treatise great. But I do not think it a final solution of the
problem. Not only are there variations of detail in the domains known to us
from the African inscriptions (some of them found since 1890). That some of
the regulations may have been taken over from those of former private owners
is a point not considered. And there is no mention of the notable requisition
of the services of <i>coloni</i> as mere retainers, to which Caesar refers without
comment (above pp 183, 254). Therefore, while I welcome the proposition
that the system of the Imperial domains had much to do with the creation of
the later Colonate, I still think that earlier and more deep-seated causes cannot
safely be ignored. Perhaps this is partly because I am looking at the matter
from a labour point of view.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LI">LI. GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>If we desire to treat History as the study of causation in the affairs
of mankind—and this is its most fruitful task—we shall find no more
striking illustration of its difficulties than the agricultural system of the
later Roman Empire. In the new model of Diocletian and Constantine
we see the imperial administration reorganized in new forms<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> deliberately
adopted: policy expresses itself, after a century of disturbance,
in a clear breach with the past. But, when Constantine in 332 legislates<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a>
to prevent <i>coloni</i> from migrating, he refers to a class of men who are
not their own masters but subject to control (<i>iuris alieni</i>), though he
distinguishes them from slaves. Evidently he is not creating a new
class: his intention is to prevent an existing class from evading its
present responsibilities. They are by the fact of their birth attached
as cultivators to their native soil. With this tie of <i>origo</i><a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> goes liability
to a certain proportion of imperial tax (<i>capitatio</i>). This is mentioned
as a matter of course. Now we know that such serf-<i>coloni</i> formed at
least a large part of the rustic population under the later Empire. We
cannot but see that the loss of the power of free migration is the vital
difference that marks off these tied farmers from the tenant farmers of
an earlier period, the class whom Columella advised landlords to retain
if possible. For these men cannot move on if they would. How came
they to be in this strange condition, in fact neither slave nor free, so
that Constantine had merely to crystallize relations already existing<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a>
and the institution of serf-tenancy became a regular part of the system?
If we are to form any notion of the conditions of farm labour in this
period, we must form some notion of the causes that produced the later
or dependent colonate. And this is no simple matter: on few subjects
has the divergence of opinions been more marked than on this. I have
stated my own conclusions above, and further considerations are adduced
in this chapter.</p>

<p>Our chief source of evidence is the collection of legal acts of the
Christian emperors issued by authority in the year 438, and known as
the <i>codex Theodosianus</i>. It covers a period of more than a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
years, and innumerable references to the land-questions attest the continual
anxiety of the imperial government to secure adequate cultivation
of every possible acre of land. Contemporary history may suggest
motives for this nervousness. The increased expenses of the court and
the administrative system made it necessary to raise more taxes than
ever for the civil services. The armies, now mainly composed of Germans
and other barbarians, were necessary for imperial defence, but
very costly to equip pay and feed. Whether they were mercenaries
drawing wages, or aliens settled as Roman subjects within the empire
on lands held by tenure of military service, they were either a burden
on the treasury or a doubtful element of the population that must at
all costs be kept in good humour. On a few occasions Roman victories
furnished numbers of barbarian prisoners to the slave-market. These
would be dispersed over various districts, generally at some distance
from the troubled frontiers, and the rustic slaves of whom we hear were
doubtless in great part procured in this way. But that the rustic population
consisted largely of actual slaves we have no reason to believe.
Of estates worked on a vast scale by slave labour we hear nothing.
Naturally; for the social and economic conditions favourable to that
system had long passed away. Slaves were no longer plentiful, markets
were no longer free. Under the Empire, the pride of great landlords
needed a strong mixture of caution; under a greedy or spendthrift
emperor the display of material wealth was apt to be dangerous. In
the century of confusion before Diocletian agriculture had been much
interrupted in many parts of the empire, and much land had gone out
of cultivation. So serious was the situation in the later part of that
period, that Aurelian<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> imposed upon municipal senates the burden of
providing for the cultivation of derelict farms.</p>

<p>When a taxpayer is required to pay a fixed amount in a stable
currency, he knows his liability. So long as he can meet it, any surplus
income remains in his hands, and he has a fair chance of improving
his economic position by thrift. If what the state really wants is (say)
corn, it can use its tax-revenue to purchase corn in the open market.
But this assumes that the producer is free to stand out for the best
price he can get, and that he will be paid in money on the purchasing
power of which he can rely for his own needs. This last condition
had ceased to exist<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> in the Roman empire. Not to mention earlier
tamperings with the currency, since the middle of the third century
its state had been deplorable. Things had now gone so far that the
value of the fixed money taxes seriously reduced the income derived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
from them: the government was literally paid in its own coin. The
policy of Diocletian was to extend an old practice of exacting payment
in kind, and this became the principal method<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> of imperial taxation.
We must bear in mind that the supply of corn for the city of Rome,
the <i>annona urbis</i>, went on as before, though the practical importance
of Rome was steadily sinking. Diocletian made it no longer the residence
of emperors, and Constantine founded another capital in the
East: but Rome was still fed by corn-tributes from the Provinces,
chiefly from Africa and Egypt. When the New Rome on the Bosporus
was fully equipped as an imperial capital, Egypt was made liable for
the corn-supply of the Constantinopolitan populace. Old Rome had
then to rely almost entirely on Africa, with occasional help from other
sources. Italy itself<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a> was now reduced to the common level, cut up
into provinces, and liable for furnishing supplies of food. But it was
divided into two separate regions: the northern, officially named <i>Italia</i>,
or <i>annonariae regiones</i>, in which a good deal of corn was grown, had
to deliver its <i>annona</i> at Mediolanum (Milan) the new imperial headquarters:
the southern, <i>suburbicariae</i> (or <i>urbicariae</i>) <i>regiones</i>, in which
little corn was grown, sent supplies of pigs cattle wine firewood lime etc
to Rome. The northern <i>annona</i>, like that from other provinces, helped
to maintain military forces and the host of officials employed by the
government. For it soon became the practice to pay salaries in kind.
In the pitiful state of the currency this rude method offered the best
guarantee for receipt of a definite value.</p>

<p>Unhappily this exaction and distribution in kind was at best a
wasteful process. At worst it was simply ruinous. The empire was
subject to constant menace of attack, and was in dire need of the largest
possible income raised on the most economical system. If the ultimate
basis of imperial strength was to be found in the food-producers, it
was all-important to give the farming classes a feeling of security sufficient
to encourage industry and enterprise, and at all costs to avoid
reducing them to despair. Nor was the new census as designed by
Diocletian on the face of it an unjust and evil institution. Taking
account of arable lands and of the persons employed in cultivating
them, it aimed at creating a fixed number<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> of agricultural units each
of which should be liable to furnish the same amount of yearly dues
in kind. But it is obvious that to carry out this doctrinaire scheme
with uniform neatness and precision was not possible. To deal fairly
with agriculture a minute attention to local differences and special
peculiarities was necessary, and this attention could not be given on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
so vast a scale. Perhaps careful observation and correction of errors
might have produced a reasonable degree of perfection in a long period
of unbroken peace: but no such period was at hand. The same strain
that drove the imperial government to the new taxation also prevented
any effective control of its working.</p>

<p>It is perhaps inevitable that the exaction of dues in kind should
lead to abuses. At all events, abuses in this department were no new
thing: the sufferings of such Provinces as Sicily and Asia were notorious
in the time of the Republic. A stricter control had made the state of
things much better in the first two centuries of the Empire. The exploitation
of the Provincials was generally checked, and the imperial
government was not as yet driven by desperate financial straits to turn
extortioner itself. Caracalla’s law of 212, extending the Roman franchise<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a>
to all free inhabitants, was a symptom of conscious need, for it
brought all estates under the Roman succession-tax. At the same time
it did away with the old distinction between the ruling Roman people
and the subject nationalities: henceforth, wherever there was oppression
within the Roman world, it necessarily fell upon Roman<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a> citizens.
Time had been when the Roman citizen, free to move into any part
of the Roman dominions and to acquire property there<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a> under protection
of Roman law, made full use of the opportunities afforded him,
to the disadvantage of the subject natives. Now all alike were the
helpless subjects of a government that they could neither reform nor
supersede; a government whose one leading idea was to bring all institutions
into fixed grooves in which they should move mechanically
year after year, unsusceptible of growth or decay. True, the plan was
absurd, and some few observers may have detected its absurdity. But
the power of challenging centralized officialism and evoking expression
of public opinion, never more than rudimentary in the Roman state,
was now simply extinct. Things had come to such a pass that, speaking
generally, a citizen’s choice lay between two alternatives. Either he
must bear an active part in the system that was squeezing out the vital
economic forces of the empire, making whenever possible a profit for
himself out of a salary or illicit gains; or he must submit passively to
all such extortions as the system, worked by men whose duty and
interest alike tended to make them merciless, was certain to inflict.
The oppressors, though numerous, could only be few in proportion to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
the whole free population. Therefore the vast majority stood officially
condemned to lives of penury and wretchedness. The system became
more hard-set and the outlook more hopeless with the lapse of time.</p>

<p>The dues exacted from the various parts of the empire varied in
quality<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> according to local conditions, and to some extent in methods
of collection. In the frontier Provinces the quantity was sometimes
reduced<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a> by remissions, when a district ravaged by invaders was relieved
for a few years that it might recover its normal productiveness.
The details of these variations are beyond the scope of the present
inquiry. The general principle underlying the whole system was the
fixing of taxation-units equal in liability, and the organizing of collection
in municipal groups. Each municipal town or <i>civitas</i> was the
administrative centre of a district, and stood charged in the imperial
ledgers as liable for the returns from a certain number of units, this
number being that recorded as existing at the last quinquennial census.
For the collection the chief municipal authorities were responsible; and
they had to hand over the amount due to the imperial authorities,
whether they had received it in full or not. Already burdened with
strictly municipal liabilities, the members of municipal senates (<i>curiales</i>)
were crushed by this additional and incalculable pressure. Unable to
resist, they generally took the course of so using their functions and
powers as to protect their own interests as far as possible. One obvious
precaution was to see that the number of taxable units<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a> in their district
was not fixed too high by the census officials. This precaution was
certainly not overlooked, and success in keeping down the number
may well have been the chief reason why the system was able to go
on so long. The <i>curiales</i> were mostly considerable landlords, residing
in their town and letting their land to tenants. But there were other
landlords, smaller men, some also resident in the towns, others in the
country. We still hear of men farming land<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a> of their own, and it seems
that some of these held and farmed other land also, as <i>coloni</i> of larger
landlords. When any question arose as to the number of units for the
tax on which this or that farm was liable, it is clear that the interests
of different classes might easily clash. And the <i>curiales</i> undoubtedly
took care<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a> that their own and those of their friends did not suffer.</p>

<p>These remarks imply that the system practically worked in favour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
of the richer classes<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a> as against the poorer. And so it certainly did,
not only in the time of revision at the census each fifth year, but on
other occasions. If an invasion or some other great disaster led the
emperor to grant temporary relief, this would normally take the form
of reducing the number of taxable units in the district for a certain
period. But the local authorities were left to apportion this reduction<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a>
among the several estates, and the poor farmers had no representative to
see that they got their fair share of relief. Moreover, outside taxation,
the farmers were often subjected to heavy burdens and damage by the
irregular requisitions of imperial officials. For instance, the staff of the
imperial post-service (<i>cursus publicus</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a> were a terror. They pressed
the goods of farmers into the service of their department on various
pretexts, and exacted labour on upkeep of roads and stations. For
their tyranny there was no effective compensation or redress. Like
other officials, they could be bought off by bribes: but this meant that
the various exactions<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a> were shifted from the shoulders of the rich to
those of the poor. Another iniquity, the revival of a very old<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a> abuse,
was connected with the question of transport, an important consideration
in the case of dues in kind, often bulky. For instance, in the case
of corn, the place at which it had to be delivered might easily count
for more in estimating the actual pressure of the burden than the amount
of grain levied. In making the arrangements for delivery there were
openings for favouritism and bribery. Circumstances varied greatly in
various parts of the empire. In some Provinces delivery was made at
a military depot within easy reach. Transport by sea from Egypt or
Africa was carried on by gilds<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> of shippers, who became more and
more organized and regulated by law. But in many parts good roads
were few, and laid out for strategic reasons; the country roads inconvenient
and rough: and for transport in bulk the post-service provided
no machinery available for the use of private persons.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to follow out in detail all the particular
discomforts and grievances of the farming classes under the system
devised by Diocletian and developed by his successors. Enough has
been said to shew that they were great, and to remove all ground for
wondering that the area of arable land actually under tillage, and with
it population, continued to decline. Constantine’s law confirming the
bondage of <i>coloni</i> to the soil by forbidding movement was the confession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
of a widespread evil, but no remedy. Repeated legislation to the same
purpose only recorded and continued the failure. When all the resources
of evasion were exhausted, the pauperized serf fled to a town and
depended for a living on the pitiful doles of private or ecclesiastical
charity, or turned brigand and took precarious toll of those who still
had something to lose. In either case he was an additional burden on
a society that already had more than it could bear. In 382 we find an
attempt<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a> made to put down ‘sturdy beggars.’ The law rewarded anyone
who procured the conviction of such persons by handing over the
offenders to him. An ex-slave became the approver’s own slave, and
one who had nothing of his own beyond his freeborn quality was granted
to him as his <i>colonus</i> for life. But this law seems to have been ineffectual
like others. Desertion of farms might to some extent be checked, but
mendicity and brigandage remained.</p>

<p>There was however another movement, later in time and less in
volume, but not less serious as affecting the practical working of the
imperial machine. With the increase of poverty life in municipal towns
became less attractive. Local eminence was no longer an object of
ambition; for to local burdens, once cheerfully borne, was now added
a load of imperial responsibilities which lay heavy on all men of property,
and which they could neither shake off nor control. In hope of evading
them, well-to-do citizens took refuge<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a> in the country, either on estates
of their own or under the protection of great landlords already settled
there. But to allow this would mean the depletion of the local senates
(<i>curiae</i>) on whose services as revenue-collectors the financial system of
the empire depended. To prevent men qualified for the position of
<i>curiales</i> from escaping that duty was the aim of legislation<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a> which by
repeated enactments confessed its own failure. That there were country
magnates, men of influence (<i>potentes</i>), whose protection might seem
able to screen municipal defaulters, is a point to be noted. They were
the great <i>possessores</i><a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a> (a term no longer applied to small men), who
held large estates organized on a sort of manorial model, and sometimes
ruled them like little principalities, territorial lordships<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> standing
in direct relations with the central authorities and not hampered by
inclusion in the general municipal scheme. Such ‘peculiars’ had existed
under the earlier Empire, and evidently continued to exist: the Crown-lands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
of the emperors, especially in Africa, were the most signal cases.
But the great private Possessor could not secure to his domain the
various exemptions<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a> that emperors conferred on theirs. He had to
collect and pay over<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> the dues from his estate, as a municipal magistrate
did from the district round his town-centre. But he had a more immediate
and personal interest in the wellbeing of all his tenants and
dependants, whose presence and prosperity gave to his land by far the
greater part<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> of its value.</p>

<p>That territorial magnates should be free to build up a perhaps
dangerous power in various corners of the empire by gathering dependants
round them, could hardly be viewed with approval by the
jealousy of emperors. Not only was the system of letting land in
parcels to tenants spreading, but the power of the landlords over them
was increasing, long before Constantine took the final step of treating
them as attached permanently to the soil. Whether they were the
landlord’s free tenants who had gradually lost through economic weakness
the effective use of freedom; or small freeholders who had found
it worth their while to part with their holdings to a big man and become
his tenants for the sake of enjoying his protection; or former
slaves to whom small farms had been entrusted on various conditions;
they were in a sort of economic bondage. Doubtless most of them lived
from hand to mouth, but we have no reason to believe that poverty,
so long as they had plenty to live on, was the motive<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> that made them
wish to give up their holdings and try their luck elsewhere. It was
the cruel pressure of Diocletian’s new taxation, and the army of officials
employed to enforce it, that drove them to despair. A contemporary
witness<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> tells us, referring to this very matter, ‘the excess of receivers
over givers was becoming so marked that farms were being abandoned,
and tillages falling to woodland, the resources of the tenants being
exhausted by the hugeness<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> of the imposts.’ And this evidence does
not stand alone. So Constantine sought a remedy in prevention of
movement, binding down the tenants to the soil. Henceforth the land
to which a <i>colonus</i><a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> was attached by birth, and the <i>colonus</i> himself, were
to be legally and economically inseparable. Attempts at evading the
new rule were persistently met by later<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> legislation. The motive of
such attempts may be found by remembering that depopulation was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
steadily lowering the value of land and raising that of labour. If an
individual landlord could add to the value of his own estate by getting
more <i>coloni</i> settled on it, withdrawn from other estates, he might profit
by the transaction: but the government, whose policy was to keep the
greatest possible area under cultivation, could not allow one part to
be denuded of labourers to suit the interest of the owner of another
part.</p>

<p>When the law stepped in to deprive the tenant, already far gone
in dependence on his landlord, of such freedom of movement as he
still retained, it is remarkable that rustic slaves were not at the same
time legally attached to the soil. That inconvenience was caused by
masters selling them when and where they chose, is shewn by Constantine’s
law<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a> of 327, allowing such sales to take place only within the
limits of the Province where they had been employed. No doubt their
removal upset the arrangements for that part of a taxable unit in which
the number of adult heads<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a> was taken into account, and so had to be
checked. But it seems not to have been till the time of Valentinian<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a>,
somewhere between 367 and 375, that the sale of a farm-slave off the
land was directly prohibited, like that of a <i>colonus</i>. In referring to this
matter, the significance of the difference of dates is thus brought out<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a>
by Seeck: ‘That this measure was carried through much sooner in
the case of the small farmers than in that of the farm-slaves, is very
characteristic of the spirit of that age. Where court favour is the deciding
factor that governs the entire policy, the government is even
more reluctant to limit the proprietary rights of the great landlord<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a>
than the liberties of the small man.’ This is very true, but we must
not forget that in both cases the binding of the labourer to the soil did
in fact restrict the landlord’s freedom of disposal. He as well as his
dependants came under a system not designed to promote his private
convenience or interest, but to guarantee a maximum of total cultivation
in the interest of the empire as a whole. So we find that he was
not allowed<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a> to raise at will the rents of his tenants: they could sue
their landlord (a right which in practice was probably not worth much),
and even when this right was restricted<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a> in 396 they still retained it
in respect of unfair increases of rent and criminal cases. So too, if he
acquired extra slaves, either by receiving them as volunteers from
derelict farms or in virtue of an imperial grant, it was strictly ordained<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
that such acquisition carried with it the tax-liability for the whole of
the derelict land. The landlord was therefore kept firmly in the grip
of the central power, and not left free to build up a little principality
by consolidating at will all the labour-resources that he could annex
as dependants. Moreover he was watched by a host of imperial agents
and spies whose interests could only be reconciled with his own by the
costly method of recurrent bribery.</p>

<p>When we return to the main question of the actual farm-labour,
and ask who toiled with their own hands to raise crops, we find ourselves
in a curious position. The evidence, whether legal or literary,
leaves us in no doubt that the tenant farmer of this period was normally
himself a labourer. And yet it is not easy to cite passages in which
this is directly affirmed. The pompous and affected language of the
imperial laws is throughout a bad medium for conveying simple facts;
nor was the question, who did the work, of any interest to the central
authority, concerned solely with the regular exaction of the apportioned
dues. The real proof that <i>coloni</i>, whether still holding some land of
their own or merely tenants, and <i>inquilini</i>, whether solely barbarian
dependants or not, were actual handworkers, is to be found in legitimate
inference from certain facts. First, the increase in the value of labour
compared with the decline in that of land. The binding of tenant to
soil was a confession of this. Secondly, the general poverty of the
farmers<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> and their helplessness against oppression and wrong. Of this
the description of Salvian gives a striking, if rhetorical, picture, and it
is implied in many laws designed<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> for their protection. That persons
in so weak an economic position could have carried on their business
as mere directors of slave-labour is surely inconceivable: and we are
to remember that not only they themselves but their families also were
bound to the soil. It was their presence, that is to say their labour,
that gave value to the land, and so paid the taxes. Hence it was that
in forming taxable units (<i>capita</i>) it was generally the practice to include
in the reckoning<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a> not only the productive area (<i>iugatio</i>) but also the
‘heads’ that stocked it (<i>capitatio</i>). In other words, productiveness must
in the interest of the state be actual, not merely potential.</p>

<p>The importance of keeping the real locally-bound <i>coloni</i> strictly to
their business of food-production was fully recognized in the regulations
for recruiting the armies. Landlords, required to furnish<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> recruits, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
free to name some of their <i>coloni</i> for that purpose. But there was no
fear that they would be eager to do this, for the work of their tenants
was what gave value to their properties. And the imperial officers
charged with recruiting duty were ordered<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> (and this in 400, when the
need of soldiers was extreme) not to accept fugitive tenants belonging
to an estate (<i>indigenis</i>): these no doubt if found were to be returned
to their lords. The military levy was to fall upon sons of veterans, for
in this class as in others no effort was spared to make the ways of life
hereditary; or on wastrels (<i>vagos</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a>, of whom the laws often make
mention; or generally on persons manifestly by the circumstances of
their birth (<i>origo</i>) liable to army service. Here we have the service
still in principle confined to freemen. But it is not to be doubted that
many a slave (and these would be nearly all rustic slaves) passed muster
with officers hasting to make up their tale of men, and so entered the
army. At a much later date (529) we find Justinian<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a> contemplating
cases of slaves recruited with the consent of their owners, in short
furnished as recruits. He enacts that such men are to be declared
<i>ingenui</i><a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a>, that is freeborn not freedmen, the master losing all rights
over them: but, if they are efficient soldiers, they are to remain in the
service. And the power of commuting<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a> the obligation of furnishing
a recruit for a payment of money, which was to some extent allowed,
introduced a method of recruiting<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> by purchase. A recruit being demanded,
it did not follow that the emperor got either the particular
man (inspected of course and passed as fit) or a fixed cash-commutation.
The recruiting officer conveniently happened to have a man or two at
disposal, picked up in the course of his tour. The landlord, anxious
to keep his own staff intact, came to terms with the officer for one of
these as substitute. These officers knew when they could drive hard
bargains, and did not lose their chances. In a law of 375, this system
is directly referred to, and an attempt is made to regulate it<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a> on an
equitable footing. To abolish it was clearly impossible. Eventually
the state undertook to work it officially, and bought its own ‘bodies’
(<i>corpora</i>, like σώματα, of slaves) with the composition-money or <i>aurum</i>
<i>temonarium</i>. That some of these ‘bodies’ were escaped slaves is highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
probable. Some may have been stray barbarians, not included in the
various barbarian corps which more and more came to form the backbone
of the Roman army. But the majority would probably be indigent
wretches to whom any change seemed better than the miserable lives
open to them in the meanest functions of the decaying civilization of
the towns. In any case such recruits<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> would be but a poor substitute
for the pick of the rustic population.</p>

<p>The same anxiety to spare the rustics unnecessary exactions, that
they might not sink under their present burdens, appears in other
regulations. The subordinates employed in the public services such
as the Post, or as attendants on functionaries, were tempted to ease
their own duties by demanding contributions from the helpless countryfolk.
This we find forbidden<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> in 321 as interfering with the farmers’
right to procure and carry home things required for agriculture. So
too a whole Title<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a> in the <i>Codex</i> is devoted to the prevention of <i>superexactiones</i>,
a form of extortion often practised by officials, chiefly by
the use of false weights and measures or by foul play with the official
receipts. The laws forbidding practices of this kind seem to belong to
the latter part of the fourth century and the earlier part of the fifth.
But the evil was clearly of old standing, and the laws almost certainly
vain. That illicit exactions were a particular affliction of the poorer
rustics, who could not bribe the officials, is confessed<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a> by a law of 362,
which ordains that the burdens of supplying beasts fodder etc for service
of the Post, upkeep of the roads and so forth, are to be laid on all
<i>possessores</i> alike. Further enactments follow in 401 and 408. But these
rules for equitable distribution of burdens, even if carried out, only
spread them over all landowners and <i>coloni</i>. All the upper ranks<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> of
the imperial service carried exemption from <i>sordida munera</i> in some
form or other, and personal grants of exemption were often granted
as a favour. It is true that such exemption only extended to the life
of the grantee, that exemptions were revocable, and that in course of
time extreme necessities led to revocations. But all this did not operate
to relieve the unhappy rustic on whom the whole imperial fabric rested.
The rich might have to lose their privileges, but it was too late for the
poor to gain a benefit. That the underlings of provincial governors
were a terror to farmers, levying on them illicit services and generally
blackmailing them for their own profit, is clear from the law<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a> (somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
368-373) announcing severe punishment for the offence and
declaring that it had become a regular practice. The law of 328,
enacting<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a> that no farmer (<i>agricola</i>) was to be impressed for special
service in the seasons of seed-time or harvest, is on rather a different
footing. It expressly justifies the prohibition on the ground of agricultural
necessity: in short, it is not to protect the farmer, but, to leave
him no excuse for not producing food.</p>

<p>A great critic<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a> has commented severely on the intellectual stagnation
that fell upon the Roman empire and was one of the most effective
causes of its decline. That literature fed upon the past and dwindled
into general imbecility is commonly recognized: but the lack of material
inventions and the paucity of improvements is perhaps not less significant
than the decay of literature and art. The department of agriculture
was no exception to this sterile traditionality. Since the days
of Varro there had been no considerable change. So far as labour is
concerned, the system of Columella can hardly be called an advance;
for it employs directly none but slave labour, a resource already beginning
to fail, and causing landlords to seek help from the development
of tenancies. In modern times the dearness of labour has stimulated
human ingenuity to produce machines by which the efficiency of human
labour is increased and therefore fewer hands required for a given
output. But in the world under the Roman supremacy centuries went
by with hardly any modification of the mechanical equipment. A small
exception may perhaps be found in a sort of rudimentary reaping-machine.
It was briefly referred to by the elder Pliny<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> in the first
century of our era, and described by Palladius in the fourth. The device
was in use on the large estates in the lowlands of Gaul, and was perhaps
a Gaulish invention. It is said to have been a labour-saving<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a>
appliance. From the description it seems to have been clumsy; and,
since it cut off the ears and left the straw standing, it was only suited
to farms on which no special use was made of the straw. Its structure
(for it was driven by an ox from behind) must have made it unworkable
on sloping ground. That we hear nothing of its general adoption
may be due to these or other defects. But I believe there is no record
of attempts to improve the original design. The lack of interest in
improvement of tools has been noted as a phenomenon accompanying
the dependence on slave labour. And when under the Roman empire
we see the free tenant passing into the condition of a serf-tenant, we
are witnessing a process that steadily tended to reduce him to the
moral labour-level of the apathetic and hopeless slave. To make the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
agriculture of a district more prosperous was to attract the attention
of greedy officials. To resist their illicit extortions was to attract the
attention of the central government, whose growing needs were ever
tempting it to squeeze more and more out of its subjects. Why then
should the rustic, tied to the soil, trouble himself to seek more economical
methods, the profits of which, if ever realized, he was not himself
likely to enjoy?</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LII">LII. LIBANIUS.</h3>

<p>In order to get so far as possible a living picture of the conditions
of rustic life and labour we must glean the scattered notices preserved
to us in the writers of the period of decline. Due allowance must be
made for the general artificiality and rhetorical bent of authors trained
in the still fashionable schools of composition and style. For even
private letters were commonly written as models destined eventually
to be read and admired by the public, while in controversial works and
public addresses the tendency to attitudinize was dominant. The circulation
of literary trivialities and exchange of cheap compliments,
especially prevalent in Gaul, was kept up to the last by self-satisfied
cliques when the barbarians were already established in the heart of
the empire. Nevertheless valuable sidelights on questions of fact are
thrown from several points of view. This evidence agrees with that
drawn from the imperial laws, and is in so far better for our purpose that
it deals almost exclusively with the present. When it looks to the future,
it is in the form of petition or advice; while the normal substance of
the laws is to confess the existence of monstrous abuses by threatening
offenders with penalties ever more and more severe, and enjoining reforms
that no penalties could enforce. A writer very characteristic of
his age (about 315-400) is the ‘sophist’ <b>Libanius</b>, who passed most
of his later years at Antioch, the luxurious chief city of the East. For
matters under his immediate observation he is a good authority, and
may help us to form a notion of the extent to which imperial ordinances
were practically operative in the eastern parts of the empire.</p>

<p>Two of the ‘orations,’ or written addresses, of Libanius are particularly
interesting as appeals to the emperor Theodosius for redress
of malpractices affecting the rustic population and impairing the
financial resources of the empire. The earlier<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> (about 385) exposes
gross misdeeds of the city magistrates of Antioch. What with the
falling of old houses and clearing of sites for new buildings there were
great quantities of mixed rubbish to be removed and deposited elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
Apparently there was now no sufficient staff of public slaves at
disposal; at all events the city authorities resorted to illegal means
for procuring the removal. When the country folk came into town to
dispose of their produce, the magistrates requisitioned their carts asses
mules (and themselves as drivers) for this work. Thus the time of the
poor rustics was wasted, their carts and sacks damaged, and they and
their beasts sent back to their homes in a state of utter exhaustion.
No law empowered the city magnates to act thus. From small beginnings
a sort of usage had been created, which nothing short of imperial
ordinance could now break and abolish. That the magistrates
were conscious of doing wrong was shewn by what they avoided doing.
They did not impress slaves or carts from houses in the city. They
did not exact like services from the military or powerful landlords.
Nor did they lay the burden on the estates<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> of the municipality, the
rents from which were part of the revenues of Antioch. Favour is only
justified by equity; and there is, says Libanius, no equity in sparing
the luxurious rich by ruining the poor. So he entreats his most gracious<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a>
Majesty to protect the farms as much as the cities, or rather more.
For the country is in fact the foundation on which cities rest. Without
it they could never have existed: and now it is on the rise and fall of
rural wellbeing that urban prosperity depends. This appeal speaks
for itself. But it is significant that the skilled pleader thinks it wise to
end on a note of imperial interest. ‘Moreover, Sire, it is from the
country that your tribute is drawn. It is to the cities that you address
your orders<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a> for taxation, but the cities have to raise it from the country.
Therefore, to protect the farmers is to preserve your interests, and to
maltreat the farmers is to betray them.’</p>

<p>In the oration numbered 47 the abuse dealt with is of a very different
kind. The date is 391 or 392, and the subject is the ‘protections’
(<i>patrocinia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a> of villages. The pressure of imperial taxation and the
abuses accompanying its collection had driven the villagers to seek
help in resisting the visits of the tax-gatherers. This help was generally
found in placing the village under the protection of some powerful
person, commonly a retired soldier, who acted as a rallying-centre and
leader, probably in most cases backed by some retainers of his own
class. Of course these men did not undertake opposition to the public
authorities for nothing. But it seems that their exactions were, at least
in the earlier stages, found to be less burdensome than those of the
official collectors. The situation thus created was as follows. The local<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
senators (<i>curiales</i>) whose turn it was to collect the dues from the district
under their municipality (a duty that they were not allowed to shirk)
went out to the villages for the purpose. They were beaten off<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a> by use
of force, often wounded as well as foiled. They were still bound to pay
over the tax, which they had not received, to the imperial treasury. In
these latter days default of payment rendered them liable to cruel
scourging. So the unhappy <i>curiales</i> had to sell their own property to
make up the amount due. The loss of their means strikes them out of
the <i>curia</i> for lack of the legal qualification. And this was not only a
loss to their particular city: it damaged imperial interests, bound up
as the whole system was with maintaining unimpaired the supply of
qualified <i>curiales</i>. The evil of these ‘protections’ was, according to
Libanius, great and widespread. The protectors had become a great
curse to the villagers themselves by their tyranny and exactions. Their
lawless sway had turned<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> farmers into brigands, and taught them to
use iron not for tools of tillage but for weapons of bloodshed. And
the trouble was not confined to villages where the land belonged to a
number of small owners: it extended also to those<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a> under one big
proprietor. The argument that the villagers have a right to seek help
in resistance to extortion, is only sound if the means employed are fair.
To justify this limitation two significant analogies<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a> are applied. Cities
near the imperial frontier must not call in the foreign enemy to aid
them in settling their differences with each other: they must seek help
within the empire. A slave must not invoke the aid of casual bystanders
against ill-usage: he stands in no relation to outsiders, and must look
to his master for redress. The full bearing of these considerations is
seen when we remember that the farmers are serf-tenants. They are
owned<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a> by masters, as the municipal city exists only in and for the
empire, and the slave has no legal personality apart from his lord.</p>

<p>It is a fact, says<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a> Libanius, that through such evasion of their liabilities
on the part of the rustics many houses have been ruined. He is
surely referring to the <i>curiales</i> and other landlords resident in the city,
the numbers of which class it was the imperial policy to maintain at
full strength. In moral indignation<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a> he urges the iniquity of beggaring
poor souls who have nothing to live on but the income from their lands.
‘Say I have an estate, inherited or bought, farmed by sensible tenants
who humbly faced the ups and downs of Fortune under my considerate
care. Must you then stir them up by agitation, arousing unlooked-for
conflicts, and reducing men of good family to indigence?’ This appeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
would not sound overdrawn in the society of that age, though it might
fall somewhat coldly upon modern ears. But the most notable point
in this oration is the nature of the remedy<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a> for which the writer pleads,
and which none but the emperor can supply. It is simply to enforce
the existing law. Some years before, probably in 368, the emperor
Valens had strictly forbidden<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a> the ‘protections’ that were the cause of
this trouble. So now the appeal to Theodosius is ‘give the law sinews,
make it a law indeed<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a> and not a bare exhortation.’ For, if it is not to
be observed, it had better be repealed. That a leading writer of the
day could so state the case to the ruler of the Roman world is a fact
to be borne in mind by readers of the imperial laws.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LIII">LIII. SYMMACHUS</h3>

<p>In passing on to <b>Q. Aurelius Symmachus</b><a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a> (about 345-405) we
find ourselves in very different surroundings. The scene is in Italy,
and the author a man of the highest station in what was still regarded
as the true centre of the Roman world. He was <i>praefectus urbi</i> in
384-5, consul in 391, and the leading figure in Roman society and
literary circles. From the bulky collection of his letters, and the forty
reports (<i>relationes</i>) addressed to the emperor by him as city prefect,
we get much interesting evidence as to the condition of rural Italy
and the anxieties of the corn-supply of Rome. With his championship
of the old religion, by which he is best known, we have here nothing
to do; and his literary affectations, characteristic of most writers of
the later Empire, do not discredit him as a witness. A remarkable
feature of his letters is their general triviality and absence of direct
reference to the momentous events that were happening in many parts of
the empire. His attention is almost wholly absorbed by matters with
which he was immediately connected, his public duties, his private
affairs, the interests of his relatives and friends, or the exchange of
compliments. His time is mostly passed either in Rome or at one or
other of his numerous country seats: for he was one of the great landlords
of his day, and the condition of Italian agriculture was of great
importance to him. As a representative of the landed interest and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
a self-conscious letter-writer he resembles the younger Pliny, but is
weaker and set in a less happy age.</p>

<p>A topic constantly recurring<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a> in his correspondence is the apprehension
of famine in Rome and the disturbances certain to arise therefrom.
The distribution of imperial powers among several seats of
government (of which Rome was not one) since the changes of Diocletian
had left to the ancient capital only a sort of traditional primacy.
The central bureaus were elsewhere, and Rome was only the effective
capital of the southern division of Italy. Yet the moral force of her
great past was still a living influence that expressed itself in various
ways, notably in the growth of the Papacy out of the Roman bishopric.
For centuries it had been the licensed lodging of a pauperized mob, fed
by doles to keep them quiet, enjoying luxurious baths at nominal cost,
and entertained with exciting or bloody shows in the circus or amphitheatre.
This rabble had either to be kept alive and amused or got rid
of; but the latter alternative would surely have reduced Rome to the
condition of a dead city. It was morally impossible for a Roman
emperor to initiate so ominous a policy. So the wasteful abomination
dragged on, and every hitch in the corn-supply alarmed not only the
<i>praefectus annonae</i> but the <i>praefectus urbi</i> with the prospect of bread
riots. And the assignment of the Egyptian corn to supply Constantinople
made Rome more than ever dependent on the fortunes of the African<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a>
harvest. When this failed, it was only by great departmental energy that
temporary shortage was made good by importations<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a> from Macedonia
Sardinia or Spain or even by some surplus from Egypt. Even lower
Italy, where little corn was grown, was at a pinch made to yield some.
But bad seasons were not the only cause of short supplies. The acts of
enemies might starve out Rome, as the rebellion of Gildo in Africa
(397-8) nearly did. Moreover the slackness and greed of officials<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a>
sometimes ruined the efficiency of the department, and ‘profiteering’
was practised by unscrupulous<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a> capitalists. Nor even with good harvests
abroad were the prefects always at ease, since the corn-fleets might be
delayed or scattered by foul weather, and meanwhile the consumption
did not cease. And it sometimes happened that the cargoes were
damaged and the public health suffered<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a> from unwholesome food.
Among these various cares the <i>praefectura annonae</i> was no bed of
roses. No wonder the worthy Symmachus tells us of private charity<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a>
to relieve the necessities of the poor, and even gives a hint of voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
rationing at the tables of the rich. But in appealing to the gods for
succour he rather suggests that human benevolence would be unequal
to the strain.</p>

<p>That agriculture was not on a sound footing in most of Italy is
evident from several passages in the letters. In one of the earliest
(before 376) he tells his father that, though he finds Campania charming,
he should like to join him at Praeneste. ‘But’ he adds ‘I am in trouble
about my property. I must go and inspect it wherever it lies, not in
hope of making it remunerative, but in order to realize the promise of
the land by further outlay. For things are nowadays come to such a
pass<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a> that an owner has to feed the farm that once fed him.’ Some of
the references to the management of estates are rather obscure. In
speaking of one near Tibur he mentions<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a> stewards (<i>vilicorum</i>) and
complains of their neglect. ‘The land is badly farmed, and great part
of the returns (<i>fructuum</i>) is in arrear (<i>debetur</i>): the <i>coloni</i> have no means
left<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a> to enable them to clear their accounts or to carry on cultivation.’
The exact status of these stewards and tenants and their relations to
each other are far from clear, and the case may have been a peculiar
one. Again, writing to bespeak the good offices of an influential man
on behalf of an applicant, he says ‘I do this for him rather as a duty<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a>
than as an act of free grace, for he is a farm-tenant of mine.’ The
tenant’s name is Theodulus, which invites a conjecture that this was a
case of an oriental Greek slave placed as tenant on a farm, either for
his master’s account, or for his own at a rent, and afterwards manumitted.
A reference to <i>servi</i>, dependants (<i>obnoxii</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a> who are owing him
rents which his agents on the distant estate in question do not take
the trouble to collect, may point to the same sort of arrangement. In
another passage he mentions<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> a man who was for a long time <i>colonus</i>
under a certain landlord, but here too the lack of detail forbids inference
as to the exact nature of the relation. That slave labour was still employed
on some Italian farms appears from a request<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a> for help in recovering
some runaways. They may have been house slaves, but if a
neighbouring landlord gave them shelter no doubt he made them pay
for it in work. The control of slaves in the country was never easy,
and the quasi-military discipline described by Columella was a confession
of this. And it was only on a large scale that a staff of overseers
sufficient to work it could be provided. The time for it was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
gone by. Slaves employed in hunting<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a> are mentioned by Symmachus
as by Pliny. No doubt they took to this occupation with zest. The
degeneracy of hunting by deputy is contemptuously noted as a sign
of the times by the soldier critic<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a> Ammianus. But it was no new thing.</p>

<p>That the general state of the countryside was hardly favourable to
the quiet development of agriculture may be gathered from many
notices. For instance, when he would have been glad to be out of
Rome for the good of his health, he complains<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a> that the prevalence
of brigandage in the country near forces him to stay in the city. A
friend urges him to come back to Rome for fear of a violent raid on an
estate apparently suburban: he can only reply<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a> that a breach of
possession during his absence will not hold good in law. Whether the
<i>militaris impressio</i><a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a> on his farm at Ostia, to which he casually refers,
was the raid of foreign foes suddenly landing on that coast, or the lawless
outrage of imperial troops, is not certain: I rather suspect the
latter. For, fifteen years later (398), after the overthrow of Gildo, he
writes<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a> that the soldiers are all back from Africa, and the Appian way is
clear: here the meaning seems plain. And his endeavour<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a> to prevent the
commandeering of an old friend’s house at Ariminum for military
quarters is significant of the high-handed treatment of civilians by
army men in those days, of which we have other evidence. Nevertheless
men were still willing to buy estates. Symmachus himself was
still adding to his vast possessions. We see him in treaty<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a> for a place
in Samnium, where there was apparently some queer practice on the
part of the seller: in another case he is annoyed<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[1654]</a> that his partner in a
joint purchase has contrived to secure the whole bargain as sole
transferee, and rather sulkily offers to waive his legal claims on being
reimbursed what he has already paid to the transferor. It seems strange
that a man who, beside his numerous properties in Italy, owned estates<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[1655]</a>
in Mauretania (where he complains that the governors allow his interests
to suffer) and in Sicily (where the lessee is called <i>conductor</i>, probably a
tenant in chief subletting to <i>coloni</i>), should have had an appetite for
more investments of doubtful economic value. But other investments
were evidently very hard to find in an age when industry and commerce
were fettered by the compulsory gild-system. And a man of influence
like Symmachus was better able than one of the common herd to
protect his own interests by the favour of powerful officials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span></p>

<p>We get glimpses of the condition of agriculture in Italy under the
strain of events. It must be borne in mind that Italy was no longer
exempt from the land-burdens of the imperial system. For many years,
certainly from 383 to 398, Rome was hardly ever free from the fear of
famine. It was necessary to scrape together all the spare food that
could be found in the country in order to eke out the often interrupted
importations from abroad. The decline of food-production in rich
Campania is indicated by many scattered references. The district was
probably too much given over to vines, and a great part of it occupied
by unproductive villas. In 396 Symmachus is relieved to know that
the corn-supply of Rome is assured, at least for twenty days. He goes
on to mention<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a> that corn has been transferred from Apulia to Campania.
Whether this was for Campanian consumption, or eventually to be
forwarded to Rome, is not stated. I am inclined to the former alternative
by the consideration of the quarrel between Tarracina and
Puteoli referred to below. That corn should have been brought from
Apulia<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">[1657]</a> is a striking fact. A great part of that province was taken up
by pastures and oliveyards. It can only have had corn to spare by
reason of sparse population and good crops. If we had the whole story
of this affair, the explanation might prove to be simpler than it can
be now. In 397 he writes<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">[1658]</a> to a friend that the Apulians are having a
bad time. They are erroneously supposed to be in for a good harvest,
and so are being required to supply corn. This will be stripping the
province without materially helping the state. For winter is coming
on, and there is not time left to bring such a great crop of ripeness.
Symmachus had friends dependent on property in Apulia. Writing
some four years later<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">[1659]</a> he refers to this estate as rated for taxation on
a higher scale than its income would warrant: he asks the local governor
to see that it shall not be crushed by ‘public burdens.’</p>

<p>For to Symmachus, as to all or most men in this passive and cruelly
selfish age, the first thought was to protect their own interests and
those of their friends by engaging the favour of the powerful. Many
of the passages cited above illustrate this, and many more could be
given. The candour of some of his applications is remarkable. On
behalf of one dependant in trouble he says<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">[1660]</a> to the person addressed
‘but he will get more help from the partiality of your judgment, for
he really has some right on his side.’ To another he writes<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">[1661]</a> that of
course right is always to be considered, but in dealing with <i>nobiles
probabilesque personas</i> a judge should feel free to qualify strict rules,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
letting the fairness of his decision appear<a id="FNanchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">[1662]</a> in the distinction made.
This proposition introduces a request on behalf of his sister. Some
farms of hers are overburdened with the dues exacted by the state, and
are now empty for lack of tenants. Only the governor’s sanction can
give them the relief needed to restore them to solvency; and Symmachus
trusts that his friend will do the right thing by the lady. In
another case<a id="FNanchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">[1663]</a> he asks favour for a dependant, significantly adding a
request that his friend will see to it that the case does not come before
another judge. Now, what chance of asserting their own rights had
humble folk in general, and poor working farmers in particular, when
governors and judges of all sorts were solicited like this by men whose
goodwill was worth securing,—men for the most part unscrupulous
greedy and prone to bear grudges, not such as the virtuous and kindly
Symmachus? Perhaps nothing shews the selfishness of the rich more
than their attempts to shirk the duty of furnishing recruits for the
army. Yet we find in one letter<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">[1664]</a> a request to a provincial governor
to check the activities of the recruiting agents. That the writer accuses
these latter of overstepping their legal powers can only be viewed with
some suspicion, considering his readiness to use private influence. Early
in 398, when a force was being raised to operate against Gildo, it was
thought necessary to enlist slaves from the city households. The protests<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">[1665]</a>
of their owners, in which Symmachus shared, were loud: the
compensation allowance was too low, and so forth. Yet, if any one
was interested in suppressing the rebel, it was surely these wealthy
men.</p>

<p>That the obligation of providing for the sustenance of the idle
populace of Rome was not only a worry to officials but a heavy burden
on farmers in the Provinces whence the supplies were drawn, needs no
detailed proof. But they were used to the burden, and bore it quietly
in average years. A very bad season might produce dearth even in
Africa, and call for exceptional measures<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a> of relief on the part of emperors.
So Trajan had relieved Egypt. It was however an extreme
step to ease the pressure in Rome by expelling<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a> all temporary residents,
as was actually done during the famine of 383. These would be nearly
all from the Provinces, and Symmachus uneasily refers<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">[1668]</a> to the resentment
that the expulsion was certain to provoke. But in this age a
rebellion of provincials to gain redress of their own particular grievances
was not a conceivable policy. When discontent expressed itself in
something more than a local riot, it needed a head in the form of a
pretender making a bid for imperial power. But we are not to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
that Rome, and later Constantinople, stood quite alone in receipt of
food-favours. The case of two Italian municipalities, reported on<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">[1669]</a> by
Symmachus in 384-5, proves the contrary, and we have no ground for
assuming that they were the only instances. The important port-town
of Puteoli was granted 150000 <i>modii</i> of corn yearly towards the feeding
of the city by Constantine. Constans cut down the allowance to 75000.
Constantius raised it again to 100000. Under Julian a complication
arose. The governor of Campania found Tarracina in sore straits
(evidently for food) because of the failure<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">[1670]</a> of the supplies due from the
towns long assigned for that purpose. Now Tarracina had a special
claim to support, since it provided Rome with firewood for heating the
baths and lime for the repair of the walls. It seems that the governor
felt bound to keep this town alive, but had no new resources on which
he could draw. So he took 5700 <i>modii</i> from the allowance of Puteoli
and gave them to Tarracina. Final settlement was referred to Julian,
but not reached before his death in the Persian war (363). The next
stage was that a deputation from Capua<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">[1671]</a> addressed the emperor Gratian,
confining themselves to complaint of their own losses. By this one-sided
representation they procured an imperial order, that the amount
of corn allowance which Cerealis<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">[1672]</a> had claimed for the people of Rome
should be given back to all the cities deprived of it by his act. But
under this order the total recovered for sustenance of the provincials
only reached 38000 <i>modii</i> of corn that had been added to the stores of
the eternal city. So Puteoli refused to hand over even the 5700 to
Tarracina. And the provincial governor did not go carefully into the
terms of the order, but ruled in favour of Puteoli. An appeal followed,
and it came out that the grant of 5700 to Tarracina was not an ordinary
bounty but an earmarked<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a> sum granted in consideration of services to
Rome. The governor did not feel able either to confirm it or to take
it away. Therefore the matter was referred to the emperors for a final
settlement. This strange story gives us a momentary glimpse of things
that make no figure in general histories. The abject dependence of the
municipalities on imperial favour stands out clearly: not less so the
precarious nature of such favours, a feature of the time amply illustrated
by the later imperial laws, numbers of which were simply issued to
withdraw privileges previously granted, under the stress of needs that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
made it impossible to maintain them. Again, we see that in addition
to the normal jealousy of neighbours the competition for imperial favour
was an influence tending to hinder rather than promote cohesion:
tending in fact to weaken the fabric now menaced by the tribal barbarians.
Above all, this affair strongly suggests the partiality of the
central government to town populations. The farmers of the municipal
territories were certainly liable to the land-burdens, and were the ultimate
basis of imperial finance: but of them there is not a word. Lastly,
we may suppose that inter-municipal disputes such as this were not
of very frequent occurrence: but we have no reason to believe that
this Campanian case was unique.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LIV">LIV. AMMIANUS.</h3>

<p>In <b>Ammianus Marcellinus</b> (about 330 to 400) we have an oriental
Greek from Antioch who passed a great part of his life in the military
service of the empire. He had travelled much, campaigned in Gaul
and the East, and was an observant man of wide interests, and in his
history impartial to the best of his power. Whether in deliberate
criticisms, or in casual references, he is an exceptionally qualified and
honest witness as to the state of things in the empire. On one important
point his evidence is of special value. All through the surviving portion
of his work (353-378) he leaves us in no doubt that the internal evils
of the empire were weakening it more than the pressure of barbarians
from without. He does not argue this in a section devoted to the topic,
but he takes occasion to notice the abuses that impaired the prosperity
of the Provinces or led directly to grave disasters. The corruption
jealousy greed cruelty and general misrule of officials high and low
was no secret to him. That the ultimate sufferers from their misdeeds
were the poor, and more particularly the poor farmers, may be gathered
from many passages. That the centre of this all-pervading disease lay
in the imperial court, a focus of intrigue and jobbery that the very
best of emperors could never effectively check, he was surely aware.
At least it is only on this assumption that we get the full flavour of
his references to court-intrigues and his criticisms of emperors, his
balanced discussions of their good and bad qualities and the effects of
their policy and practice. In truth the whole system was breaking
down. It lasted longer in the East than in the West, because the
eastern peoples were more thoroughly tamed. They had been used
to despotic government long before the coming of Rome. And the
assaults of external enemies were more formidable and persistent in
the North and West than in the South and East. Yet, so long as the
empire held together, imperial despotism was inevitable. Neither
Ammianus nor any other writer of that age did or could offer a possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
alternative. Christianity might capture the empire and spread among
the barbarians, but it had no constructive solution for the problems of
imperial government.</p>

<p>A remarkably plain-spoken passage<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a> occurs in reference to the events
of 356, where he describes the administration of Julian in Gaul. By
his victories over the Germans he relieved the impoverished Gauls, but
this was by no means his only benefit. For instance, where he found
at his first coming a tax-unit<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a> of 25 gold pieces demanded as the
<i>tributum</i>, at his departure (360) he left things so much improved that
seven of these sufficed to meet all dues. Great was the joy in Gaul.
As a particular example of his thoughtful care, Ammianus cites his
policy in the matter of arrears of tribute. There were occasions, especially
in provinces liable to invasion, when it was certain that such arrears
could not be recovered in the ordinary course. It was not to the interest
of the central government to ruin or turn adrift farmers whose places
it would not be easy to fill. This consideration was no doubt used to
procure from emperors orders of remission, <i>indulgentiae</i><a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a> as they were
called. Julian to the last would not give relief by thus waiving the
imperial rights. ‘For he was aware<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a> that the effect of that step would
be to put money into the pockets of the rich; the universal practice,
as everyone knows, being for the poor to be made to pay up the due
amount in full directly the order of collection is issued, and allowed
no time of grace.’ It seems then that it was not the amount of the
imperial taxation, but the iniquities perpetrated in connexion with its
collection, that were the real burden crushing the vitality of the
Provinces. So thought Julian, rightly: and in the next year we find him
firmly upholding his principles in the face of exceptional difficulties.
The emperor Constantius had felt compelled to make Julian Caesar,
and to place him at the head of the Western section of the empire.
But his jealousy and fear of the Caesar’s winning glory in Gaul led
him to surround Julian with officers devoted to himself and secretly
encouraged to hamper their titular chief in every possible way. The
court of Constantius was a hotbed of intrigue and calumny. Private
reports of the doings of Julian were being regularly received. Any
reforms that he was able to make in Gaul had to be effected in the
teeth of imperial malignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span></p>

<p>A flagrant instance<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a> is seen in the efforts made to thwart his
reforming energy during the winter of 357-8. After defeating and
humbling aggressive German tribes, he set himself to relieve the distress
of the landowners, who had suffered great losses. There was at
the time a great need of money. The praetorian prefect of the Gauls,
Florentius, proposed to raise the sums required<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a> by an additional levy,
and procured from Constantius an order to that effect. Julian would
rather die than allow this. He knew what would happen in carrying
it out, and that such ‘precautions’ (<i>provisiones</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">[1680]</a> or rather destructions
(<i>eversiones</i>) had often brought provinces into the extremities of want.
The Prefect, to whose department the matter in strictness belonged,
protested loudly, relying on the powers given him by Constantius.
But Julian stood firm, and tried to soothe him by calmly proving that
there was no necessity for the proposed measure. Careful calculations
shewed that the normal impost (<i>capitatio</i>) would produce enough to
furnish the needful supplies, and something to spare. He would have
nothing to do with the order<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">[1681]</a> for an extra levy. The Prefect duly
reported this to Constantius, who reprimanded the Caesar for his obstinacy.
Julian replied that the provincials had been exposed to ravages
from various quarters, and that if they were still able to render the
usual dues<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a> the government had reason to be thankful. To wring more
out of men in distress by punishments was impossible. And he did
manage to prevent extraordinary exactions in Gaul. In the winter of
358-9 he continued the same policy. He saw to the equitable assessment<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">[1683]</a>
of the tribute, and kept at bay the horde of rascally officials who
made fortunes<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a> out of injuring the people. The corruption of the law-courts
he checked by hearing the important cases himself. No wonder
that in an age of Christian emperors the virtuous pagan earned a
reputation as a restorer of Roman greatness far beyond the boundaries
of Gaul. Whether the fact that adherents of polytheism were now
chiefly to be found among rustics (<i>pagani</i>) had anything to do with
Julian’s clear appreciation of the sufferings of countryfolk, is a question
on which I cannot venture to offer an opinion.</p>

<p>That all or most of the corn levied by imperial taxation was in the
frontier Provinces required for the military commissariat is well known,
and the granaries for storing it were a leading feature of permanent
camps and garrison towns. The feeding of armies in the field, always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
wasteful, no doubt consumed a great deal. In the case of Gaul (for to
live on the country was starvation to a force invading wild Germany)
the quantity to be brought up to the front seems to have been normally
more than Gaul could spare. It was usual to rely on the harvests<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a> of
Britain. Transport was the main difficulty. Saxon pirates infested the
narrow seas, and the navigation of the Rhine was blocked by Franks.
Julian’s energy cleared away these obstacles, and saw to the erection
or repair of granaries in the Rhineland towns to receive the British
corn. These measures enabled him to do without making extra demands
on the farmers of Gaul, a step sometimes unavoidable when there was
war on the frontiers. Of course such commandeering was very unpopular,
and wise generals avoided it whenever possible. Ammianus
draws particular attention<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">[1686]</a> to this matter when narrating the campaign
of Theodosius in Mauretania (373). He forbade the levy of supplies
from the provincials, announcing that he would make the stores of the
enemy<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">[1687]</a> provide the commissariat, and the landowners were delighted.</p>

<p>Among the interesting references that occur in the course of the
work are some that throw further light on the conditions of life in the
parts of the empire subject to invasion. It is not necessary to cite the
frequent mention of various kinds of fortified posts from great strongholds
to mere blockhouses. These remind us that the strength of the
imperial armies could never be so maintained as to guard the frontier
at all times on all points. Barbarian raiders slipped through<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a> the inevitable
gaps, and wide stretches of country were laid waste long before
sufficient forces could be gathered to expel them. We do not need
the descriptions of their cruel ravages to convince us that agriculture
near the Danube or Rhine borders was a perilous calling. If the farmer
were not carried away into bondage or slain, he was left robbed of his
all, and in imminent danger of starving: for the barbarians ate up
everything, and hunger was a principal motive in leading them to come
and warning them to return home. Naturally it was the custom in
these border-lands to provide fortified refuges here and there in which
local farmers could find temporary shelter with their belongings, and
homesteads of any importance were more or less equipped for defence.
This was the state of things even in Mauretania. We read of a farm<a id="FNanchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a>
(<i>fundus</i>) which the brother of Firmus the rebel leader (373) ‘built up
after the fashion of a city’; also of one girt with a strong<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">[1690]</a> wall, a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
secure refuge for the Moors, to destroy which Theodosius had to employ
battering-rams. These are not the only instances. And forts (<i>castella</i>)
and walled towns are often referred to. Along the northern borders
the necessity for such precautions was much greater. Still it seems
that few if any in the latter part of the fourth century foresaw that
frontier defences would at no distant date give way before the barbarian
flood. A high imperial official, with whose corrupt connivance<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">[1691]</a> gross
wrongs had been perpetrated (370) in Africa, on being superseded in
office withdrew to his native Rhineland, and ‘devoted himself<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">[1692]</a> to rural
affairs.’ The retired ease for which he apparently hoped was soon ended,
though not by barbarian raiders. The malignity of a praetorian prefect
tracked him to his retreat and by persecution drove him to suicide.</p>

<p>This last episode may remind us that the weakening of the empire
was not wholly due to failure of an economic kind or to decay of
military skill. The farmers might raise crops enough, the armies might
prove their superiority in the field, but nevertheless the great organism
was in decline. A general mistrust, fatal to loyal cooperation for the
common good, was the moral canker by which the exertions of farmer
and soldier were hampered and rendered vain. Officials seeking to ruin
each other, emperors turning to murders and confiscations as a source
of revenue, all classes bound fast in rigid corporations or gilds under
laws which it was their study to evade; the failure of individual enterprise,
lacking the joy of individual freedom, and the stimulus of expected
reward; in short, everyone ready to sacrifice his neighbour to save his
own skin: how was a society characterized by such phenomena to
maintain a moral advantage over the rude barbarians? That it was
now protected by alien swords, that aliens were even commanding<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[1693]</a>
the Roman armies, was not the main cause of its overthrow. As a rule
these barbarians kept their bargain, and shed their blood freely for the
empire that enlisted them in masses. But we must distinguish between
two or three different classes of these alien defenders. The mere mercenaries
need not detain us. More significant were the contingents
taken over in large bodies by agreement with the tribes. A good instance<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">[1694]</a>
is that of the year 376, when a vast host of Goths sought leave to
pass the Danube with the hope of settling on vacant lands south of the
river. We are told that the Roman commanders on that front got over
their first alarm and took the line that really the emperor was in luck.
Here was a huge supply of recruits<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">[1695]</a> brought to him from the ends of the
earth, an unlooked-for reinforcement ready to be blended with his own
troops, and to make up an unconquerable army. Instead of spending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
the yearly payments of the provinces<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">[1696]</a> on filling up the ranks, the
treasury would gain a great sum of gold. It would seem that they
reported to the emperor in favour of the request, for Valens granted
the petition of a Gothic embassy. Arrangements were made for transporting
them over the river, and it was understood that they had leave
to settle in the parts of Thrace. But now troubles began. Greedy
Roman officials fleeced and maltreated the hungry horde, who were
at length driven into rebellion. With the sequel, the great battle (378)
near Adrianople, and the death of Valens, we are not here concerned.
But the account<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">[1697]</a> of their ravages in Thrace gives us a picture of the
countryside in a harassed province and of the slave labour employed.
The rebels, unable to take fortified places by regular siege, overran the
country in raiding bands. Captives guided them to places stocked with
food. But they were especially encouraged and strengthened by the
great number of people of their own race who came pouring in to join
them. Ammianus describes<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">[1698]</a> these deserters as men who had long before
been sold (into slavery of course) by traders, and with them very many
whom at the time of their passing the river, when they were perishing
of hunger, they had bartered for thin wine or worthless scraps of bread.</p>

<p>This scene may serve to remind us that slavery and the sale of
slaves to Roman dealers were recognized features of German tribal life
as described by Tacitus. It also gives us a glimpse of the way in which
opportunities of imperial advantage could be wasted or turned into
calamities by the unpatriotic and selfish greed of Roman officials. In
this case potential recruits were turned into actual enemies; and the
barbarian slaves, who should have been tilling Thracian fields in the
interest of Rome, were left to guide and recruit the hostile army of
their kinsmen. It must not be supposed that all schemes for raising
barbarian troops in large bodies were thus by gross mismanagement
brought to a disastrous end. The value of sound flesh and blood in the
ranks was well understood, and a successful campaign against German
tribes could be made profitable from this point of view. Thus in 377,
when Gratian had a whole tribe at his mercy, he required of them a
contingent<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">[1699]</a> of sturdy recruits to be incorporated in Roman army-units,
on delivery of whom he set free the rest to return to their native homes.
That such recruits became under Roman discipline so far Romanized
as to provide efficient armies is clear from the victories that still delayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
the fall of the empire. But ‘Roman’ was becoming more than ever a
mere name-label: there had never been a Roman nation. Of the third
class of alien soldiery little need be said. Military colonists of barbarian
origin had for a long time past been brought into the empire, some as
frontier guards holding land on condition of army service, others more
in the interior, even<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">[1700]</a> in Italy; and these latter undoubtedly furnished
many recruits, on whatever terms. The general result may be summed
up in saying that, when the barbarian invaders at last came to stay,
they found their kindred already there at home.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LV">LV. CLAUDIAN.</h3>

<p>In <b>Claudian</b>, who wrote about 400, we have another oriental Greek,
who wrote chiefly in Latin with far more mastery of that language than
Ammianus. Stilicho his patron, the great barbarian head of the Roman
army, was at the height of his power, and Claudian’s most congenial
occupation was to sing his praises and denounce his opponents. He
was also poet laureate of the feeble emperor Honorius. Writing mainly
on contemporary themes, he is, if allowance be made for his bias, a
witness worth citing; but the passages relevant to the present subject
are naturally few. In common with other writers of the later ages of
Rome he is constantly looking back to a great and glorious past, contrasting
painfully with that present which he nevertheless is striving to
glorify. Thus he not only refers with enthusiasm<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">[1701]</a> to the old heroes of
Roman history and legend, the common material of Roman literature,
but even dreams<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">[1702]</a> of a golden age to be, when the earth of her own
accord shall render all good things in abundance to a people living
happily in communistic brotherhood. This fancy however is no more
than a piece of unreal rhetoric, an echo of Vergil. It is inspired by the
victories of Stilicho, and the world-dominion under which this beatific
vision is to be realized is—the rule of Honorius.</p>

<p>In January 395 the great Theodosius died, and the empire was
divided between his two sons. In November, Rufinus, who dominated
Arcadius at Constantinople, was murdered. His place was soon taken
by the eunuch Eutropius. On these two personages Claudian poured
out a flood of invective, speaking for Stilicho and the West. The greed
of Rufinus is depicted<a id="FNanchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">[1703]</a> as ruinous to the landed interests. ‘The fertility
of his land was the ruin of the landlord: a good crop<a id="FNanchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a> made the farmers
tremble. He drives men from their homes, and thrusts them out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
their ancestral borders, either robbing the living or seizing the estates
of the dead.’ The jealousy of the West expresses itself in a passage<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a>
referring to the famine created in Rome by the rebellion of Gildo in
Africa. Honorius (that is Stilicho) is effusively praised for its relief by
importations from other Provinces, chiefly from Gaul. That, owing to
the claim of the New Rome to the corn of Egypt, the Old Rome should
be so dependent on Africa, is a situation indignantly resented<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">[1706]</a> in eloquent
lines. A symptom ominous of imperial failure was the attempt
to wrest eastern Illyricum from the rule of Arcadius (407-8) an enterprise<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a>
secretly concerted between Stilicho and Alaric. Fugitives from
Epirus sought refuge in Italy. Stilicho treated them as prisoners of
war from an enemy’s country, and handed them over to Italian landlords
as slaves or <i>coloni</i>. When Alaric and his Goths moved towards
Italy, some of these refugees, aided by a law issued for their protection,
found their way home again. Claudian unblushingly declares<a id="FNanchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">[1708]</a> that
none but Stilicho will be able to heal the empire’s wound: ‘at length
the <i>colonus</i> will return to his own borders and the court will once more
be enriched by the tributes of Illyricum.’</p>

<p>A Roman view of the intruding barbarians and their capacity of
peaceful settlement is in one place<a id="FNanchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">[1709]</a> put into the mouth of Bellona the
war-goddess. She addresses a Gothic chief in bitter sarcasm. ‘Go and
be a thorough ploughman, cleaving the soil: teach your comrades to
lay aside the sword and toil at the hoe. Your Gruthungians<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">[1710]</a> will make
fine cultivators, and tend vineyards in accordance with the seasons.’
She taunts him with degenerating from the good old habits of his race,
war and plunder, and scornfully describes him as one captured<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">[1711]</a> by the
glamour of fair dealing, who had rather live as a serf on what is granted
him than as a lord on what he takes by force. In short, he is a coward.
Now no doubt there were Goths and others, Huns in particular, of this
war-loving work-hating type approved by the war-goddess. But abundant
evidence shews that many, perhaps most, of the barbarians were
quite ready to settle down in peace and produce their own food. When
Claudian himself speaks<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">[1712]</a> of the ‘Teuton’s ploughshare’ as one of the
agencies producing corn that relieved famine in Rome, he is most likely
referring to the many Germans already settled in Gaul as well as to
inhabitants of the ‘Germanies,’ the two provinces along the Rhine.</p>

<p>A curious passage<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">[1713]</a> in the poem on the Gothic war and Stilicho’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
defeat of Alaric at Pollentia (402) is of interest in connexion with the
Roman army and the recruiting system. Of the confidence revived in
Rome by the appearance of Stilicho and his troops a vivid picture is
drawn, and he continues ‘henceforth<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">[1714]</a> no more pitiful conscription, no
more of reapers laying down the sickle and wielding the inglorious
javelin ... nor the mean clamorous jangling of amateur leaders: no, this
is the presence of a genuine manhood, a genuine commander, a scene
of war in real life.’ If this means anything, it implies that hasty levies<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a>
of raw countrymen were notoriously unfit to face hordes of barbarian
tribesmen in the field. True, no doubt; professional training had been
the basis of efficiency in Roman armies ever since the days of Marius.
But the words surely suggest further that conscription within the empire
was in Claudian’s time not found a success, that is in producing a supply
of fit recruits to keep the legions up to strength. This also was doubtless
true, as much other evidence attests, and was the main reason why
the ‘Roman’ soldiery of the period were mostly barbarians. But here,
as usual, the witness of the court-poet is in the form of admission rather
than statement. His business was to be more Roman than Rome. It
remains only to mention two similes, one of which perhaps refers to
free labour. An old crone<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">[1716]</a> has ‘poor girls’ under her engaged in
weaving. They beg for a little holiday, but she keeps them at work
‘to earn their joint livelihood.’ This may be a scene from life, but is
more likely an echo from earlier poetry. When he illustrates<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a> the effect
of Stilicho’s coming on the peoples rising against Rome by comparing
them to slaves, deceived by false report of their lord’s death, and caught
revelling by him when he unexpectedly returns, it is a scene that might
be enacted in any age. The little poem on the old man of Verona is
famous as a picture of humble contentment in rustic life. But the main
point of it as evidence is that the case is exceptional.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LVI">LVI. VEGETIUS.</h3>

<p><b>Vegetius</b>, a contemporary of Ammianus and Claudian, is credited
with two surviving works, one on the military system, the other on
veterinary practice. Both are largely compilations, and belong to the
class of technical writings which formed a great part of the literature
of this age. In discussing army matters the author looks back with
regret to the sounder conditions of the past. Speaking<a id="FNanchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">[1718]</a> of the quality
of recruits, he says ‘It can surely never have been matter of doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
the common countryfolk are more fit (than townsfolk) to bear arms,
reared as they are in toil under the open sky, able to stand the heat of
the sun and caring not for the shade, with no experience of baths or
knowledge of luxuries, straightforward and frugal, with limbs hardened
to endure any kind of toil; for the wearing of armour, digging of
trenches, and carrying their kit, are continuations of rustic habit.’ It
is true that sometimes town-bred recruits have to be levied, but they
need long and careful training to fit them for active service. True, the
Romans of old went out to war from the city. But luxury was unknown
in those days: the farmer of today was the warrior of tomorrow, by
change of weapons. Cincinnatus went straight from the plough to
be dictator. A little after, speaking<a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a> of the standard of height, he
tells us that it has always been usual to have a standard tested by
actual measurement, below which no recruit was passed for service in
certain crack units. But there were then<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a> larger numbers to draw from,
and more men followed the combatant service, for the civil service<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a> had
not as yet carried off the pick of those in military age. Therefore, if
circumstances require it, strength rather than height should be the
first consideration. I am loth to infer much<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a> from this passage, the
period referred to in ‘then’ being undefined. What it does shew is that
in the writer’s own time a considerable number of men of military age
(Romans being meant) were attracted by the civil career of the new
imperial service, which in all its grades was technically styled<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a> a <i>militia</i>.
Nor does it appear certain that in preferring the rustic recruit to the
urban Vegetius implies the existence of a plentiful supply of the former
among the subjects of the empire. His words rather suggest to me the
opposite conclusion, which is in agreement with the evidence from other
sources.</p>

<p>Turning to the veterinary work (<i>ars mulomedicinae</i>) we come upon
a chapter devoted<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">[1724]</a> to the management of horses. It is well to keep a
free space near the stable for the beasts to get exercise by rolling, for
they need exercise. ‘And for this end it is very helpful to have them
mounted<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">[1725]</a> often and ridden gently. Unskilful riders spoil both their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
paces and their temper. Most mischievous is the recklessness<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a> of slaves.
When the master is not there, they urge his horses to gallop, using
spur as well as whip, in matches of speed with their mates or in fiercely-contested
races against outsiders: it never occurs to them to halt or
check their mounts. For they give no thought<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a> to what is their master’s
loss, being well content that it falls on him. A careful owner will most
strictly forbid such doings, and will only allow his cattle to be handled
by suitable grooms who are gentle and understand their management.’
We must bear in mind that the horse was not used in agriculture or as
an ordinary beast of burden. Horse-breeding was kept up to supply
chargers for war, racers for the circus, mounts for men of the wealthier
classes in hunting or occasionally for exercise, for solemn processions
and such like. When Vegetius treats of a stable or stud of horses, he
has in mind the establishment of a gentleman of means, and it is worth
noting that such an establishment could be contemplated by a writer
of about 400 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. This harmonizes with the picture of Italian conditions
that we get from the letters of Symmachus and other sources. A few
rich were very rich, the many poor usually very poor. The carelessness,
wastefulness, thievishness, of slaves is a very old story, and in the middle
of the fourth century had been bitterly referred to<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a> by the emperor
Julian. That Vegetius does not advise the owner of these slave grooms
to make a <i>vilicus</i> responsible for seeing that his orders are obeyed, is
probably due to the rigidly technical character of the treatise: he is
not writing on the management of estates.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHRISTIAN_WRITERS">CHRISTIAN WRITERS</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LVII">LVII. LACTANTIUS.</h3>

<p>When we turn to the Christian writers, whom it is convenient to
take by themselves, we pass into a different atmosphere. Of rhetoric
there is plenty, for most of them had been subjected to the same literary
influences as their Pagan contemporaries. But there is a marked difference
of spirit, more especially in one respect very important from the
point of view of the present inquiry. Christianity might counsel submission
to the powers that be: it might recognize slavery as an institution:
it might enjoin on the slave to render something beyond eye-service
to his legal master. But it could never shake off the fundamental
doctrine of the equal position of all men before their Almighty Ruler,
and the prospect of coming life in another world, in which the standards
and privileges dominating the present one would go for nothing. Therefore
a Christian writer differed from the Pagan in his attitude towards
the poor and oppressed. He could sympathize with them, not as a
kindly though condescending patron, but as one conscious of no abiding
superiority in himself. The warmth with which the Christian witnesses
speak is genuine enough. The picture may be somewhat overdrawn
or too highly coloured, and we must allow for some exaggeration, but
in general it is surely true to fact.</p>

<p>First comes <b>Lactantius</b>, who has already<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a> been once quoted.
Writing under Constantine, he speaks of the Diocletian or Galerian
persecution as a contemporary. The passage<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a> to be cited here describes
the appalling cruelty of the fiscal exactions ordered by Galerius to
meet the pressing need of the government for more money. It was
after the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305. The troubles
that ensued had no doubt helped to render financial necessities extreme.
The remark, that he now practised against all men the lessons of cruelty
learnt in tormenting the Christians, must refer to Galerius. The account
of the census<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">[1731]</a>, presumably that of 307, is as follows. ‘What brought
disaster on the people and mourning on all alike, was the sudden letting
loose of the census on the provinces and cities. Census-officers, sparing
nothing, spread all over the land, and the scenes were such as when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
an enemy invades a country and enslaves the inhabitants. There was
measuring of fields clod by clod, counting of vines and fruit trees,
cataloguing of every sort of animals, recording of the human<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a> heads.
In the municipalities (<i>civitatibus</i>) the common folk of town and country
put on the same<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">[1733]</a> footing, everywhere the market-place crammed with
the households assembled, every householder with his children and
slaves. The sounds of scourging and torturing filled the air. Sons were
being strung up to betray parents; all the most trusty slaves tortured
to give evidence against their masters, and wives against husbands.
If all these means had failed, men were tortured for evidence against
themselves, and when they broke down under the stress of pain they
were credited with admissions<a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a> never made by them. No plea of age
or infirmity availed them: informations were laid against the invalids
and cripples: the ages of individuals were recorded by guess, years
added to those of the young and subtracted from those of the old. All
the world was filled with mourning and grief.’ In short, Romans and
Roman subjects were dealt with as men of old dealt with conquered
foes. ‘The next step was the paying<a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a> of moneys for heads, a ransom
for a life. But the whole business was not entrusted to the same body
of officials (<i>censitoribus</i>); one batch was followed by others, who were
expected to make further discoveries: a continual doubling of demands
went on, not that they discovered more, but that they made additions
arbitrarily, for fear they might seem to have been sent to no purpose.
All the while the numbers of live stock were falling, and mankind
dying; yet none the less tribute was being paid on behalf of the dead,
for one had to pay for leave to live or even to die. The only survivors
were the beggars from whom nothing could be wrung, immune for the
time from wrongs of any sort by their pitiful destitution.’ He goes on
to declare that, in order to prevent evasion of the census on pretence
of indigence, a number of these poor wretches were taken out to sea
and drowned.</p>

<p>In this picture<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a> we may reasonably detect high colouring and
perhaps downright exaggeration. Probably the grouping together of
horrors reported piecemeal from various quarters has given to the
description as a whole a somewhat deceptive universality. That the
imperial system, though gradually losing ground, held its own against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
unorganized barbarism for several more centuries, seems proof positive
that no utter destruction of the economic fabric took place in the census
to which Lactantius refers. But that the pressure exerted by the central
power, and the responsive severity of officials, were extreme, and that
the opportunities for extortion were seized and cruelly used, may fairly
be taken for fact on his authority. This was not the beginning of
sufferings to the unhappy tillers of the soil, nor was it the end. One
census might be more ruinous to their wellbeing than another: it was
always exhausting, and kept the farmers in terror. But they had not
as yet reached the stage of thinking it better to bear the yoke of barbarian
chieftains than to remain under the corrupt and senseless
maladministration of imperial Rome.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LVIII">LVIII. SULPICIUS SEVERUS.</h3>

<p>The life and doings of the famous saint of Gaul, Martin of Tours,
a Pannonian by birth, were chronicled by <b>Sulpicius Severus</b>, writing
soon after 400, in an enthusiastic biography still in existence. In another
work occurs a passage<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> narrating one of his hero’s many miracles; and
the story is too artlessly illustrative of the behaviour of the military
and the state of things on the public roads, not to be mentioned here.
Martin was travelling on his ecclesiastical duties, riding on an ass with
friends in company. The rest being for a moment detained, Martin
went on alone for a space. Just then a government car (<i>fiscalis raeda</i>)
occupied by a party of soldiers was coming along the road. The mules
drawing it shied at the unfamiliar figure of the saint in his rough and
dark dress. They got entangled in their harness, and the difficulty of
disentangling them infuriated the soldiers, who were in a hurry. Down
they jumped and fell upon Martin with whips and staves. He said not
a word, but took their blows with marvellous patience, and his apparent
indifference only enraged them the more. His companions picked him
up all battered and bloody, and were hastening to quit the scene of
the assault, when the soldiers, on trying to make a fresh start, were
the victims of a miracle. No amount of beating would induce the mules
to stir. Supernatural influence was suspected and made certain by
discovery of the saint’s identity. Abject repentance was followed by
gracious forgiveness, and mules and soldiers resumed their journey.
Now the point of interest to us is the matter-of-fact way in which this
encounter is narrated. That a party of the military should bully peaceful
civilians on the high road is too commonplace an event to evoke
any special comment or censure. But it is clearly an edifying fact that
violence offered to a holy man did not escape divine punishment. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
is no suggestion that similar brutality to an ordinary rustic would have
met with any punishment human or divine. Laws framed for the protection
of provincials<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a> against illegal exactions and to prevent encroachments
of the military<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a> remained on the statute-book, but in remote
country parts they were dead letters. It is interesting to recall that
Martin had in his youth served for some years as a soldier. As the
son of a veteran, his enrolment<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">[1740]</a> came in the ordinary course. But,
though he is said to have been efficient, he did not like the profession
and got his discharge with relief. His life covered about the last three
quarters of the fourth century.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LIX">LIX. SALVIAN.</h3>

<p>The calamities that befel the Roman world in the fourth century
led to much recrimination between Pagan and Christian, each blaming
the other for misfortunes generally regarded as the signal expression
of divine wrath. Symmachus had been answered by Ambrose, and
Christian interpretation of the course of human history produced its
classic in Augustine’s great work <i>de civitate Dei</i> early in the fifth century.
About the same time Orosius wrote his earnest but grotesque <i>historiae
adversus paganos</i>, an arbitrary and superficial distortion of history,
interesting as a specimen of partisan composition. But it is not till
the middle of the century that we come upon a Christian author who
gives us a graphic picture of the sufferings of the people in a Province
of the empire, and a working theory of their causes, strictly from
a pious Christian’s point of view. This is <b>Salvian</b>, an elder of the
Church at Massalia. His evidence is cited by all historians, and must
be repeated here. The main thesis is that all the woes and calamities
of the age are judgments of God provoked by the gross immorality<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">[1741]</a>
of the Roman world. So far from imputing all vices and crimes to the
Heathen and the Pagan, he regards them as shared by all men: but
he draws a sharp line between those who sin in ignorance, knowing
no better, and those who profess the principles of a pure Christianity
and yet sin against the light that is in them. For the barbarians are
either Heathen or Heretics (he is thinking of the Arians), while in the
empire the Orthodox church prevails. And yet the barbarians prosper,
while the empire decays. Why? simply because even in their religious
darkness the barbarians are morally superior to the Romans. For our
present purpose it is the economic and social phenomena as depicted
by Salvian that are of interest, and I proceed to give an abstract of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
passage<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">[1742]</a> in which he expounds his indictment of Roman administration
and the corrupt influences by which it is perverted from the promotion
of prosperity and happiness to a cause of misery and ruin.</p>

<p>The all-pervading canker is the oppression of the poor by the rich.
The heavy burdens of taxation are thrown upon the poor. When any
relief is granted, it is intercepted by the rich. Franks Huns Vandals
and Goths will have none of these iniquities, and Romans living among
those barbarians also escape them. Hence the stream of migration sets
from us to them, not from them to us. Indeed our poor folk would
migrate in a body, but for the difficulty of transferring their few goods
their poor hovels and their families. This drives them to take another
course. They put themselves under the guardianship and protection
of more powerful persons, surrendering<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">[1743]</a> to the rich like prisoners of
war, and so to speak passing under their full authority and control.
But this protection is made a pretext for spoliation. For the first condition
of protection is the assignation<a id="FNanchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">[1744]</a> of practically their whole substance
to their protectors: the children’s inheritance is sacrificed to pay
for the protection of their parents. The bargain is cruel and one-sided,
a monstrous and intolerable wrong. For most of these poor wretches,
stripped of their little belongings and expelled from their little farms,
though they have lost their property, have still to bear the tribute on
the properties lost: the possession is withdrawn, but the assessment<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">[1745]</a>
remains: the ownership is gone, but the burden of taxation is crushing
them still. The effects of this evil are incalculable. The intruders
(<i>pervasores</i>) are settled down (<i>incubant</i>) on their properties, while they,
poor souls, are paying the tributes on the intruders’ behalf. And this
condition passes on to their children. So they who have been despoiled
by the intrusion<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">[1746]</a> of individuals are being done to death by the pressure
of the state (<i>publica adflictione</i>), and their livelihood is taken from them
by squeezing as their property was by robbery. Some, wiser or taught
by necessity, losing their homes and little farms through intrusions or
driven by the tax-gatherers to abandon them through inability to keep
them, find their way to the estates of the powerful, and become<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a> serf-tenants
(<i>coloni</i>) of the rich. Like fugitives from the enemy or the law,
not able to retain their social birthright, they bow themselves<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">[1748]</a> to the
mean lot of mere sojourners: cast out of property and position, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
have nothing left to call their own, and are no longer their own masters.
Nay, it is even worse. For though they are admitted (to the rich
men’s estates) as strangers (<i>advenae</i>), residence operates to make
them<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[1749]</a> natives of the place. They are transformed as by a Circe’s cup.
The lord of the place, who admitted them as outside<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">[1750]</a> aliens, begins to
treat them as his own (<i>proprios</i>): and so men of unquestioned free
birth are being turned into slaves. When we are putting our brethren
into bondage, is it strange<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[1751]</a> that the barbarians are making bondsmen
of us?</p>

<p>This is something beyond<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">[1752]</a> mere partisan polemic. It finds the
source of misery and weakness in moral decay. Highly coloured, the
picture is surely none the less true. The degradation of the rustic
population presents itself in two stages. First, the farmer, still owning
his little farm (<i>agellus</i>, <i>rescula</i>), finds that, what with legal burdens and
illegal extortions, his position is intolerable. So he seeks the protection<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">[1753]</a>
of a powerful neighbour, who exploits his necessities. Apparently he
acquires control of the poor man’s land, but contrives to do it in such
a form as to leave him still liable to payment of the imperial dues.
That this iniquity was forbidden<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[1754]</a> by law mattered not: corrupt officials
shut their eyes to the doings of the rich. From the <i>curiales</i> of the
several communities no help was to be looked for. Salvian declares<a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">[1755]</a>
that they were tyrants to a man. And we must not forget that they
themselves were forced into office and held responsible for paying in
full the dues they were required to collect. The great machine ground
all, and its cruel effects were passed on from stronger to weaker, till
the peasant was reached and crushed by burdens that he could not
transmit to others. The second stage is the inevitable sequel. The
poor man’s lot is more intolerable than before. His lesson is learnt,
and he takes the final step into the status of a rich man’s <i>colonus</i>.
Henceforth his lord is liable<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">[1756]</a> for his dues, but he is himself the lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
serf, bound to the soil on which his lord places him, nominally free, but
unable to stir from the spot<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">[1757]</a> to which his labour gives a value. If he
runs away, the hue and cry follows him, and he is brought ignominiously
back to the servile punishment that awaits him—unless he can make his
way to some barbarian tribe. Whether he would find himself so much
better off in those surroundings as Salvian seems to imply, must be
left doubtful. Any family that he might leave behind would remain in
serfage under conditions hardly improved by his desertion.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LX">LX. APOLLINARIS SIDONIUS.</h3>

<p>The last of our array of witnesses is <b>Apollinaris Sidonius</b><a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[1758]</a> (about
430-480), a writer whose life is singularly illustrative of the confused
period in which the Roman empire was tottering and the series of
luckless emperors was ended in the West. Britain had been finally
lost in the time of Honorius. The Armorican provinces had rebelled,
and even now the hold of Rome on them was slight and precarious.
The rest of Gaul and much of Spain and Africa had been subject to
barbarian inroads, and numbers of the invaders were settled in the
country: for instance, the Western Goths were fully established in
Aquitania. But the Roman civilization was by no means wiped out.
Roman landlords still owned large estates: Romans of culture still
peddled with a degenerate rhetoric and exchanged their compositions
for mutual admiration. Panegyrics on shadowy emperors were still
produced in verse and prose, and the modern reader may often be
amazed to note the way in which the troubles of the time could be
complacently ignored. Above all, there was the Church, closely connected
with Rome, claiming to be Catholic and Orthodox, a stable
organization, able to make itself respected by the barbarians. That
the latter were Arian heretics was indeed a cause of friction, though
the Arians were destined to go under. The conversion of the Franks
under the Catholic form did not give Roman Christianity the upper
hand till 496. But the power of bishops, ever growing<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">[1759]</a> since the days
of Constantine, was throughout a powerful influence holding the various
communities together, maintaining law and order, and doing much for
the protection of their own people. A native of Lugudunum, the chief
city of Gaul, Sidonius came of a noble and wealthy family, and his
social position evidently helped him in his remarkable career. In 468
he was city prefect at Rome, barely eight years before Odovacar removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
the last of the titular Western emperors. We find him anxiously
concerned<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[1760]</a> with the old food-question, like his predecessor Symmachus,
and not less endeavouring to cooperate harmoniously with the <i>praefectus
annonae</i>. For a hungry rabble, no doubt fewer in number, still hung
about the Eternal city, though its services in the way of applause were
no longer in appreciable demand.</p>

<p>From about 471 Sidonius was bishop<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[1761]</a> of Arverni (Clermont in
Auvergne), and performed his difficult duties with efficiency and dignity,
a sincerely pious man with a good deal of the <i>grand seigneur</i> about
him. Moving about on duty or seeking restful change, he was often
visiting country houses, his own or those of friends, receiving or returning
hospitality. His references to these visits lead to descriptions<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[1762]</a>
of many pleasant places, and pictures of life in the society of cultivated
gentlemen to which he belonged. There is hardly any mention of the
suffering farmers of whom Salvian speaks so eloquently. Yet I hesitate
to charge Salvian with gross exaggeration and imaginative untruth.
Not only do the two men look from different points of view. Sidonius
is writing some twenty years later than Salvian, and much had happened
in the meantime. The defeat of Attila in 451 by the armies of
the Romans and Western Goths had not only saved Gaul from the
Huns, but had greatly improved the relations between Goth and Roman.
And it is to be noted that, in a passage<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[1763]</a> mentioning the victory of the
allies and the reception of Thorismund the Gothic king as a guest
at Lugudunum, Sidonius praises his correspondent<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">[1764]</a> for his share in
lightening the burdens of the landowners. Now Salvian knows nothing
of the battle of 451, and indeed does not regard the Huns as being
necessarily enemies of Rome. It seems certain that for the rustics
things were changed for the better. Not that the farmer was his own
master, but that the great Roman taxing-machine was no longer in
effective action. A great part of Gaul had passed under Teutonic lords.
If the subjects were exposed to their caprice, it was of a more personal
character, varying with individuals and likely to be modified by their
personal qualities. This was a very different thing from the pressure
of the Roman official hierarchy, the lower grades of which were themselves
squeezed to satisfy the demands of the higher, and not in a
position to spare their victims, however merciful their own inclinations
might be.</p>

<p>But though the establishment of barbarian kingdoms, once the
raiding invasions were over, had its good side from the working farmer’s
point of view, much of the old imperial system still lingered on. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
power of the Catholic Church stood in the way of complete revolution,
and the Church was already<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">[1765]</a> a landowner. Roman traditions died hard,
and among them it is interesting to note the exertion of private interest
on behalf of individuals and causes in which an honourable patron felt
some concern. Thus we find Sidonius writing<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[1766]</a> on behalf of a friend
who wants to buy back an ancestral estate with which recent troubles
have compelled him to part. Great stress is laid on the point that the
man is not grasping at pecuniary profit but actuated by sentimental
considerations: in short, the transaction proposed is not a commercial
one. The person addressed is entreated to use his influence<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">[1767]</a> in the
applicant’s favour; and we can only infer that he is asked to put
pressure on the present owner to part with the property, probably to
take for it less than the market price. Another letter<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[1768]</a> is to a bishop,
into whose district (<i>territorium</i>) the bearer, a deacon, fled for refuge
to escape a Gothic raid. There he scratched a bit of church-land and
sowed a little corn. He wants to get in his crop without deductions.
The bishop is asked to treat him with the consideration usually shewn
to the faithful<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">[1769]</a>;
    that is, not to require of him the season’s rent<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">[1770]</a>. If this
favour is granted him, the squatter reckons that he will do as well as
if he were farming in his own district, and will be duly grateful. Very
likely a fair request, but Sidonius does not leave it to the mere sense
of fairness in a brother bishop. To another bishop he writes a long
letter<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">[1771]</a> of thanks for his thoughtful munificence. After the devastation
of a Gothic raid, further damage had been suffered by fires among the
crops. The ensuing distress affected many parts of Gaul, and to relieve
it this worthy sent far and wide bountiful gifts of corn. The happy
results of his action have earned the gratitude of numerous cities, and
Sidonius is the mouthpiece of his own Arverni. The affair illustrates
the beneficence of good ecclesiastics in troubled times. For Gaul was
not enjoying tranquil repose. The barbarians were restless, and the
relations<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">[1772]</a> between their kings and the failing empire were not always
friendly. Religious differences too played a part in preventing the
coalescence of Gallo-Roman and Teuton. The good bishop just referred
to is praised by Sidonius as a successful converter of heretics.</p>

<p>The fine country houses with their vineyards and oliveyards and
general atmosphere of comfort and plenty shew plainly that the invasions
and raids had not desolated all the countryside. The first need
of the invaders was food. Wanton destruction was not in their own
interest, and the requisitioning of food-stuffs was probably their chief
offence, naturally resented by those who had sown and reaped for their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
own consumption. If we admit this supposition, it follows that their
operations, like those of other successful invaders, would be directed
mainly to the lowland districts, where most of the food-stuffs were
produced. Now the country houses of Sidonius and his friends were,
at least most of them, situated in hilly country, often at a considerable
distance from the main<a id="FNanchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">[1773]</a> roads, among pleasant surroundings which
these kindly and cultivated gentlemen were well qualified to enjoy.
It is evident that some, perhaps many, of these snug retreats were not
seriously<a id="FNanchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">[1774]</a> molested, at all events in southern and south-eastern Gaul.
Roughly speaking, the old and most thoroughly Romanized provinces,
the chief cities of which were Lugudunum and Narbo, were still seats
(indeed the chief seats) of Roman civilization. It was there that the
culture of the age survived in literary effort sedulously feeding on the
products and traditions of the past. Sidonius thinks it a pity<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[1775]</a> that men
of education and refinement should be disposed to bury their talents
and capacity for public service in rural retreats, whether suburban or
remote. The truth probably was that town life had ceased to be attractive
to men unconcerned in trade and not warmly interested in
religious partisanship. The lord of a country manor, surrounded by his
dependants, could fill his store-rooms and granaries<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[1776]</a> with the produce
of their labour. He still had slaves<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[1777]</a> to wait on him, sometimes even
to work on the land. With reasonable kindliness and care on his part,
he could be assured of comfort and respect, the head of a happy rustic
community. The mansions of these gentry, sometimes architecturally<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[1778]</a>
fine buildings, were planted in spots chosen for local advantages, and
the library was almost as normal a part of the establishment as the
larder. Some of the owners of these places gave quite as much of their
time and attention to literary trifling as to the management of their
estates. The writing of letters, self-conscious and meant for publication,
after the example of Pliny the younger, was a practice of Sidonius.
The best specimen of this kind is perhaps the long epistle<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[1779]</a> in which
he describes minutely a place among the foot-hills of the Alps. Every
attraction of nature seconded by art is particularized, down to the
drowsy tinkling of the bells on the mountain flocks accompanied by
the shepherd’s pipe. No doubt the effective agriculture<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[1780]</a> of Gaul had
little in common with these Arcadian scenes. The toiling <i>coloni</i>, serfs
of a barbarian chief or a Roman noble, were all the while producing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
the food needed to support the population; and it is a convincing proof
of the superficiality of Sidonius as an observer of his age that he
practically ignores them.</p>

<p>To attempt a full description of society in Roman Gaul of the fifth
century is quite beyond my scope. It has already been admirably done
by Sir Samuel Dill. But there are a few points remaining to be discussed
as relevant to my subject. That the decline of the middle class,
and the passing of large areas of land into few hands, was a process
forwarded by inability to pay debts incurred, is extremely probable.
It had been going on for many centuries. But I do not see that the
evidence of Sidonius suggests that this evil was in his time especially
prevalent. The case cited<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[1781]</a> is peculiar. The borrower is expressly stated
not to have mortgaged any of his land. The loan was only secured by
a written bond which fixed the interest<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[1782]</a> at 12% per annum. This had
been ten years in arrear, and the total debt was now doubled. The
debtor fell ill, and pressure was put on him by officials employed to
collect debts. I infer that the lack of real security prompted this
dunning of a sick man, for fear the personal security might lapse by
his death. Sidonius, a friend of the creditor, undertook to plead with
him for at least some stay of action. This man had lately been ordained,
and Sidonius (not yet himself in orders, I think,) was evidently surprised
to note the simple religious life led by him in his country villa. And
he needed little entreaty, but acted up to what he considered his duty
to a brother Christian. He not only granted further time for payment,
but remitted the whole of the accrued interest, claiming only the principal
sum lent. Such conduct may have been, and probably was, exceptional;
but I cannot argue from it that heartless usurers were eating
up the small landowners of Gaul.</p>

<p>So too the case of the young man<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">[1783]</a> of good position who cast off a
slave mistress and wedded a young lady of good family, reputation,
and property, may have been exceptional. Sidonius takes it all very
coolly, and mildly improves the occasion. A far more interesting affair
is one in a lower station of life, of which I must say a few words. In
a brief letter<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">[1784]</a> to his friend Pudens he says ‘The son of your nurse has
raped my nurse’s daughter: it is a shocking business, and would have
made bad blood between you and me, only that I saw at once you did
not know what to do in the matter. You begin by clearing yourself
of connivance, and then condescend to ask me to condone a fault committed
in hot passion. This I grant, but only on these terms, that you
release<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">[1785]</a> the ravisher from the status of a Sojourner, to which he belongs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
by birth; thus becoming his patron instead of his lord. The woman is
free already. And to give her the position of a wedded wife, and not
the plaything of caprice, there is but one way. Our scamp for whom
you intercede must become your Client<a id="FNanchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">[1786]</a> and cease to be a Tributary,
thus acquiring the quality of an ordinary Commoner rather than that
of a Serf.’ Sidonius is as usual ready to make the best<a id="FNanchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">[1787]</a> of a bad job.
From his proposal I draw the following conclusions. First, as to the
nurses. The <i>nutrix</i>, like the Greek τροφός, held a position of trust and
respect in the household, consecrated by immemorial tradition. No
slave had a higher claim to manumission, if she desired it. It would
seem that Sidonius’ ‘mammy’ was ending her days as a freedwoman,
and hence her daughter was free. It looks as if the nurse of Pudens
were still a slave, and her son an <i>inquilinus</i> on the estate of Pudens.
He may very well have been tenant of a small holding, practically a
serf-tenant. Pudens is still his <i>dominus</i>. His quality of <i>inquilinus</i>
attaches to him in virtue of his <i>origo</i>; that is, he is registered in the
census-books<a id="FNanchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">[1788]</a> as a human unit belonging to a particular estate and
taken into account in estimating taxation-units. Therefore he is <i>tributarius</i><a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">[1789]</a>.
Sidonius proposes to divest him of the character of serf and
make him an ordinary Roman citizen. The difference this would make
is probably a purely legal one. Being at present a Serf, probably in
strict law a slave also, his connexion with the girl is a <i>contubernium</i>.
His manumission<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">[1790]</a> (for such it really is) will enable him to convert it
into a <i>matrimonium</i>, carrying the usual legal responsibilities. The
practical change in his economic position will probably be nil. He will
still remain a dependent <i>colonus</i>, but he may perhaps enjoy the privilege
of paying his own share<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">[1791]</a> of taxes. That Sidonius speaks of his present
condition first as Inquilinate and then as Colonate, is one of many
proofs that the two terms now connoted virtually<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">[1792]</a> the same thing. Such
had already been stated as a fact in a law of Honorius, which was
retained by Tribonian in the code of Justinian. Whether the <i>inquilini</i>
were barbarian bondsmen (<i>hörige</i>), tenants bound to the soil like <i>coloni</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
but the personal property of their landlords, as Seeck holds; or usually
descendants of <i>coloni</i>, as Weber thought; is more than I can venture
to decide. I do not think that either hypothesis<a id="FNanchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">[1793]</a> exhausts all the
possibilities, and the point is not material to the present inquiry. In
any case it can hardly be doubted that both classes consisted of
men who worked with their own hands, only aided in some cases by
slave labour which was far from easy to procure.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXI">LXI. CONCLUDING CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>After so long a discussion of the surviving evidence, it is time to
sum up the results and see to what conclusions the inquiry leads us in
respect of the farm life and labour of the Greco-Roman world. And
first as to the figures of the picture, the characters with whose position
and fortunes we are concerned. We find three classes, owner farmer
labourer, clearly marked though not so as to be mutually exclusive.
We can only begin with ownership in some form, however rudimentary;
for the claim to resist encroachment on a more or less ill-defined area
is a phenomenon of even the rude life of hunter-tribes. How private
property grew out of common ownership is a question beyond the
range of the present inquiry. It is enough that the owner, whether a
clan or a family or an individual, has a recognized right to use the
thing owned (here land) and to debar others from doing so. But it is
clear that he may also be the actual manager of its use: he may even
supply in person all the labour needed for turning it to account: in
short, he may be his own farmer and his own labourer. And legend
asserts or implies that such was the primitive condition of man when
he passed from nomadic to settled existence. Differentiation of function
is therefore a product of time and circumstance, a development varying
in date and degree among various races and in various portions of the
world. Once the stage of civilization is reached at which the regular
cultivation of the same piece of land year by year is the normal means
of sustaining human life, we meet the simplest economic figure, the
peasant who supplies his own needs by his own methods, tilling the
soil which in some sense he claims as his own. Whether it is his own
permanently as an individual, or temporarily as a member of a village
community, is a difference immaterial from the present point of view.
Nor does it matter that his method of dealing with the land may be
regulated by principles conventional in the society to which he belongs.</p>

<p>Delegation of management is a momentous step, destined to bring
important unforeseen consequences. Many reasons may have rendered
it necessary or at least convenient. It appears in two forms, the actual
and relative dates of which are hardly to be determined with certainty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
Either the owner keeps the profit of the undertaking and bears the
loss, or some division of profit and loss between the owner and the
manager is the condition of the arrangement between the two parties.
Ownership is not abdicated: nor is it easy to see how, without a clear
recognition of ownership, any system of delegation could arise. But
on the first plan the owner owns not only the land but the service of
his delegate. Whether the man be a client bound to his patron by
social custom, or an agent earning a wage, or a slave the property of
his master, he is merely a servant in charge. He can be superseded at
any moment at the landowner’s will. The free tenant on the other hand
is a creature of contract, and his existence presupposes a community in
which the sanctity of deliberate bargains is considerably developed.
Whether the tenant’s obligation consists in the payment of a fixed rent
in money or kind, or in a share of produce varying with the season’s
crop, does not matter. He is bound by special law, however rudimentary;
and it is the interest of the community to see that such law is
kept in force: for no one would enter into such bargains if their fulfilment
were not reasonably assured. Whether a certain reluctance to
enter into such a relation may perhaps account for the rare and doubtful
appearance of tenancy in early Roman tradition, or whether it is to be
set down simply to defects of record, I do not venture to decide. The
landlord’s obligation is to allow his tenant the enjoyment and free use
of a definite piece of land on certain terms for a stipulated period.
Further stipulations, giving him the right to insist on proper cultivation
and the return of the land in good condition at the end of the tenancy,
were doubtless soon added at the dictation of experience. That tenant
farmers with their families usually supplied labour as well as management,
is surely not to be doubted. That, in the times when we begin
to hear of this class as non-exceptional, they also employed slave
labour, is attested: that we do not hear of them as engaging free wage-earners,
may or may not be an accidental omission.</p>

<p>Labour, simply as labour, without regard to the possible profit or
loss attending its results, was no more an object of desire, engaged in
for its own sake, in ancient times than it is now. Domestication of
animals, a step implying much attentive care and trouble, was a great
advance in the direction of securing a margin of profit on which mankind
could rely for sustenance and comfort. The best instance is
perhaps that of the ox, whose services, early exploited to the full, were
cheaply obtained at the cost of his rearing and keep. Hence he was
kept. But in ages of conflict, when might was right, the difference<a id="FNanchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">[1794]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
between an ox-servant and a man-servant had in practice no existence,
and the days of theory were as yet in the far future. A human enemy,
captured and spared, could be put to use in the same way as a domesticated
ox. His labour, minus the cost of his keep, left a margin of
profit to his owner. At the moment of capture, his life was all he had:
therefore his conqueror had deprived him of nothing, and the bargain
was in his favour, though economically in his owner’s interest. No
wonder then that our earliest records attest the presence of the slave.
Even nomad tribes were attended by slaves<a id="FNanchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">[1795]</a> in their migrations, nor
indeed has this custom been wholly unknown in modern times. On
the other hand it is remarkable how very little we hear of wage-earning
labour in ancient agriculture. Nothing seems to imply that it was ever
a normal resource of cultivation. When employed, it is almost always
for special work at seasons of pressure, and it seems to have remained
on this footing, with a general tendency to decline. In other words,
the margin of profit on the results of wage-earning labour seemed to
employers less than that on the results of slave labour, so far as ordinary
routine was concerned. And we are not in a position to shew that in
their given circumstances their judgment was wrong. But we need to
form some notion of the position of the wage-earning labourer in a
civilization still primitive.</p>

<p>The main point ever to be borne in mind is that the family household
was a close union of persons bound together by ties of blood and
religion under a recognized Head. A common interest in the family
property carried with it the duty of common labour. The domestic
stamp was on everything done and designed. Even the slave had a
humble place in the family life, and family religion did not wholly
ignore him. He was there, and was meant to stay there. Farm-work
was the chief item in the duties of the household, and he bore, and was
meant to bear, his full share of it. But the hired labourer stood in no
such relation to the household union, however friendly his connexion
with his employer might be. He did his work, took his wage, and
went: no tie was severed by his going, and any other person of like
capacity could fill his place if and when the need for help-service
arose. In short, his labour was non-domestic, irregular, occasional: and
therefore less likely to receive notice in such records as have come
down to us. But if we conclude (as I am inclined to do) that wage-labour
was not much employed on the land in early times, we must
admit that this is rather an inference than an attested tradition.</p>

<p>The distinction between domestic regular service and non-domestic
help-service is essential, and on a small holding from which a family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
raised its own sustenance the line of division was easy to draw. Later
economic changes tended to obscure it, and we find Roman jurists<a id="FNanchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">[1796]</a> of
the Empire striving to discover a full and satisfactory answer to a much
later question, namely the distinction between a domestic and a rustic
slave. But by that time ‘domestic’ appears as ‘urban,’ for the effect of
centuries has been to draw a really important line of division, not
between slave and free but between two classes of slaves. There is
however in the conditions of early slavery, when ‘domestic’ and ‘rustic’
were merely two aspects of the same thing, another point not to be
overlooked, since it probably had no little influence on the development
of human bondage. It is this. The human slave differs from the
domesticated ox through possession of what we call reason. If he
wished to escape, he was capable of forming deep-laid plans for that
purpose. Now the captives in border wars would be members of neighbouring
tribes. If enslaved, the fact of being still within easy reach of
their kindred was a standing temptation to run away, sure as they
would be of a welcome in their former homes. No kindness, no watchfulness,
on the master’s part would suffice to deaden or defeat such an
influence. To solve the problem thus created, a way was found by
disposing of captives to aliens more remote and getting slaves brought
from places still further away. This presupposes some commercial intercourse.
In the early Greek tradition we meet with this slave-trade
at work as a branch of maritime traffic chiefly in the hands of Phoenician
seamen. In Italy we find a trace of it in the custom<a id="FNanchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">[1797]</a> of selling ‘beyond
Tiber,’ that is into alien Etruria. At what stage of civilization exactly
this practice became established it is rash to guess: we cannot get
behind it. The monstrous slave-markets of the historical periods shew
that it developed into a normal institution of the ancient world. But
it is not unreasonable to suppose that an alien from afar was less easily
absorbed into his master’s family circle than a man of a neighbouring
community though of another tribe. Are we to see in this the germ
of a change by which the house-slave became less ‘domestic’ and tended
to become a human chattel?</p>

<p>The exploitation of some men’s labour for the maintenance of
others could and did take another form in ages of continual conflict.
Successful invaders did not always drive out or destroy the earlier inhabitants
of a conquered land. By retaining them as subjects to till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
the soil, and making the support of their rulers the first charge upon
their produce, the conquerors provided for their own comfort and
became a leisured noble class. In the Greek world we find such aristocracies
of a permanently military character, as in Laconia and Thessaly.
Colonial expansion reproduced the same or very similar phenomena
abroad, as in the cases of Heraclea Pontica and Syracuse. The serfdom
of such subject populations was a very different thing<a id="FNanchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">[1798]</a> from slavery.
It had nothing domestic about it. There is no reason to suppose that
the serf was under any constraint beyond the regular performance of
certain fixed duties, conditions imposed by the state on its subjects,
not the personal orders of an individual owner. In some cases at least
the serf seems to have enjoyed a measure of protection<a id="FNanchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">[1799]</a> under public
law. Whether the original Roman <i>plebs</i> stood on much the same footing
as the Greek serfs is perhaps doubtful, but their condition presents
certain analogies. The main truth is that the desire of conquerors to
profit by the labour of the conquered was and is an appetite almost
universal: moral revulsion against crude forms of this exploitation is
of modern, chiefly English, origin; even now it is in no small degree
a lesson from the economic experience of ages. But it is well to remember
that we use ‘serfdom’ also as the name for the condition of
rural peasantry in the later Roman Empire, and that this again is a
different relation. For it is not a case of conquered people serving
their conquerors. Rather is it an affliction of those who by blood or
franchise represent the conquering people. Step by step they sink under
the loss of effective freedom, though nominally free, bound down by
economic and social forces; influences that operate with the slow certainty
of fate until their triumph is finally registered by imperial law.</p>

<p>That the institution of Property is a matter of slow growth, is now
generally admitted by sincere inquirers. It had reached a considerable
stage of development when a clan or household (still more when an
individual) was recognized as having an exclusive right to dispose of
this or that material object presumably useful to others also. For
instance, in the right of an owner to do as he would with an ox or a slave.
Individual property in land was certainly a later development, the appropriation
being effected by a combination of personal acquisitiveness
with economic convenience. From my present point of view the chief
interest of the property-question is in its connexion with debt-slavery.
That farmers, exposed to the vicissitudes of seasons, are peculiarly
liable to incur debts, is well known from experience ancient and modern.
But ancient Law, if rudimentary, was also rigid; and tradition depicts
for us the small peasant as a victim of the wealthy whose larger capital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
enabled them to outlast the pressure of bad times. How far the details
of this picture are to be taken literally as evidence of solid fact has
not unreasonably been doubted. But that a farmer in straits could
pledge not only his land but his person as security for a debt seems
hardly open to question. For we find the practice still existing in historical
periods, and political pressure exerted to procure mitigation of
the ancient severity. Now, if a man gave himself in bondage to a
creditor until such time as his debt should be discharged, he became
that creditor’s slave for a period that might only end with his own life.
Here we have another way in which the man of property could get the
disposal of regular labour without buying a slave in the market or
turning to work himself. A later form of the practice, in which a debtor
worked off his liability<a id="FNanchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">[1800]</a> by service at an estimated rate, a method of
liquidation by the accumulation of unpaid wages, seems to have been
a compromise avoiding actual slavery. Evidently subsequent to the
abolition of debt-slavery, it died out in Italy, perhaps partly owing to
the troublesome friction that would surely arise in enforcing the obligation.</p>

<p>It is natural to ask, if we find small trace of eagerness to labour in
person on the land, and ample tradition of readiness to devolve that
labour on slaves and subjects, how comes it that we find agriculture in
honour, traditionally regarded as the manual labour beyond all others
not unworthy of a freeman? To reply that human life is supported by
the produce of the land is no sufficient answer. To recognize the fact
of necessity does not account for the sentiment of dignity. Now, in
the formation of such unions as may fairly be called States, the commonest
if not universal phenomenon is the connexion of full citizenship
with ownership of land. Political movement towards democracy is
most significantly expressed in the struggles of landless members of
inferior right to gain political equality. Whether the claim is for allotments
of land, carrying a share of voting-power, or for divorcing the
voting-power from landholding, does not matter much here. At any
rate it was the rule that no alien could own land within the territory
of the state, and state and territory were coextensive. Only special
treaties between states, or a solemn act of the sovran power in a state,
could create exceptions to the rule. From this situation I would start
in attempting to find some answer to the above question. In a village
community I think it is generally agreed that all true members had a
share of the produce, the great majority as cultivators, holding lots of
land, not as tenants at will or by contract, but in their own right, though
the parcels might be allotted differently from time to time. If a few
craftsmen were left to specialize in necessary trades for the service of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
all, and drew their share in the form of sustenance provided by the
cultivating members, the arrangement presented no insuperable difficulty
on a small scale. But the tillers of the soil were the persons on
whose exertions the life of the community primarily and obviously
depended. The formation of a larger unit, a State, probably by some
successful warrior chief, made a great change in the situation. A city
stronghold established a centre of state life and government, and
villages exchanged the privileges and perils of isolation for the position
of local hamlets attached to the common centre of the state, and in this
new connexion developing what we may fairly call political consciousness.
Under the new dispensation, what with growth of markets, the
invention of coined money, and greater general security, the movement
towards individual property proceeded fast. Noble families engrossed
much of the best land: and tradition<a id="FNanchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">[1801]</a> credibly informs us that in one
mode or other they imposed the labour of cultivation on the poorer
citizens, of course on very onerous terms.</p>

<p>At this point in the inquiry some help may be got from taking the
military view. War, at least defensive war, was a possibility ever
present. Kings, and the aristocracies that followed them, had as their
prime function to secure the safety of the state. A sort of regular force
was provided by the obligation of army service that rested upon all
full citizens. The warrior nobles and their kinsmen formed a nucleus.
But the free peasant farmers were indispensable in the ranks, and, as
their farms usually lay near the frontier, they furnished a hardy and
willing militia for border warfare. The craftsmen, smith potter cobbler
etc, were now more concentrated in the city, and were always regarded
as ill-fitted for service in the field. Naturally the classes that bore a
direct part in defence of the state stood higher in general esteem. But
to say this is not to say that bodily labour on the land was, as labour,
honoured for its own sake. The honour belonged to those who, owning
land, either worked it with their own hands or employed the labour of
others. I can find no trace of traditional respect for the labourer as
labourer until a much later age, when a dearth of free rustic labourers
had begun to be felt. Then it appeared in the form of yearning<a id="FNanchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">[1802]</a> for a
vanished past, side by side with humanitarian views in relation to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
slavery. Meanwhile a stage had been traversed in which slavery was
recognized as necessary in spite of its admitted evils, and therefore
requiring justification; a movement most clearly illustrated by the
special pleading of Aristotle. That great writer was fully alive to the
manifold merits of the farmer class as citizens and producers, but his
trust in the power of self-interest proves him a confirmed individualist.
How to combine self-interest with patriotic devotion to the common
welfare is the vital problem, even now only solved ideally on paper.
That coldly-reasoned conclusions of thinkers were really the foundation
of the esteem in which we find the working farmer held, I cannot
believe. Much more likely is it that it sprang mainly from immemorial
tradition of a time when ownership and cultivation went together, and
that theory merely absorbed and revived what was still an indistinct
impression in the minds of men.</p>

<p>The Greeks had a significant word, ἀυτουργός, the usage of which
may serve to illustrate my meaning. That it connotes the fact of a
man’s bearing a personal part in this or that work is clear on the face
of it. That no other person also bears a part, is sometimes implied by
the context, but it is not necessarily contained in the word itself. To
put it differently, he does his own work, not necessarily all his own
work. I note two points in connexion with it that seem to me important.
First, it is so often used as descriptive of rustic labour that it
seems to have carried with it associations of farm-life: most of the
other uses are almost metaphorical, some distinctly so. Secondly, I
have never found it applied to the case of a slave. Why? I think,
because it conveyed the further notion of working not only yourself
but for yourself. If in some passages it is not quite certain that an
owner (rather than a tenant) is referred to, surely this extension of
meaning is not such as to cause surprise. It is not enough to suggest
serious doubt that the common and full sense of the word was that a
man did work with his own hands on his own account on his own land.
This was the character to which immemorial tradition pointed; and,
whenever tenancy under landlords began, the word fitted the working
tenant-farmer well enough. The Romans had the tradition in the most
definite form, though Latin furnished no equivalent word. Their
literature, moralizing by examples and unapt for theory, used it as
material for centuries. But neither in the Greek world nor in
Italy can I detect any reason for believing that the peasant farmer,
idealized by later ages, is rightly to be conceived as a person unwilling
to employ slave labour—if and when he could get it. The
tradition, in which rustic slaves appear from very early times, seems
to me far more credible than late legends of a primitive golden age
in which there were no slaves at all. That a man, to be enslaved, must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
first have been free, is a piece of speculation with which I am not here
concerned.</p>

<p>Tradition then, looking back to times when landowner and citizen
were normally but different sides of the same character, both terms
alike implying the duty of fighting for the state, idealized and glorified
this character with great but pardonable exaggeration of virtues probably
not merely fictitious. The peasant citizen and producer was its
hero. As the devolution of bodily labour upon slaves or hirelings
became more common with the increase of commerce and urban life,
and the solid worth of a patriot peasantry became more evident in
the hour of its decay, men turned with regret to the past. And the
contrast of the real present with an idealized past naturally found a
significant difference in the greater or less willingness of men to work
with their own hands, particularly on the land. But it was the labour
of free citizens, each bearing an active part in the common responsibilities
of the state and enjoying its common protection, that was
glorified, not labour as in itself meritorious or healthy. The wholesomeness
of rustic toil was not ignored, but to urge it as a motive for bodily
exertion was a notion developed by town-bred thinkers. That it
coloured later tradition is not wonderful: its recognition is most clearly
expressed in the admission of superior ‘corporal soundness’ in the
sparely-fed and hard-worked slave or wage-earner. But labour as
labour was never, so far as I can learn, dignified and respected in
Greco-Roman civilization. Poverty, not choice, might compel a man
to do all his own work; but, if he could and did employ hired or slave
labour also, then he was an ἀυτουργός none the less. This I hold to be
an underlying fact that Roman tradition in particular is calculated to
obscure. It was voluntary labour, performed in a citizen’s own interest
and therefore a service to the state, that received sentimental esteem.</p>

<p>The power of military influences in ancient states is often cited as
a sufficient explanation of the social fact that non-military bodily
labour was generally regarded with more or less contempt. The army
being the state in arms, the inferiority of those who did not form part
of it though able-bodied was manifest to all. This is true as far as it
goes, but there was something more behind. Why does not the same
phenomenon appear in modern states with conscript armies, such as
France or Italy or above all Switzerland? I think the true answer is
only to be found by noting a difference between ancient and modern
views as to the nature and limits of voluntary action. It is only of
states in which membership is fairly to be called citizenship that I am
speaking; and as usual it is Greek conditions and Greek words that
supply distinct evidence. Not that the Roman conditions were
materially different, but they were perhaps less clearly conceived, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
the record is less authentic and clear. Now, beyond the loyal obedience
due from citizen to state, any sort of constraint determining the action
of one free man by the will of others was feared and resented to a
degree of which we cannot easily form an adequate notion. In the
gradual emancipation of the commons from the dominion of privileged
nobles, the long struggle gave a passionate intensity to the natural
appetite for freedom. And the essence of freedom was the power of
self-disposal. This power was liable to be lost permanently by sale
into slavery, but also from time to time by the effect of temporary
engagements. The most obvious instance of the latter condition was
the bondage created by unpaid debt. Hence the persistent and eventually
successful fight to make it illegal to take a borrower’s person as
security for his debt. But, suppose the debt cancelled by the seizure
of his goods, the man was left a pauper. His only resource was to
work for wages, and this placed him for the time of his engagement at
the full disposal<a id="FNanchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">[1803]</a> of his employer. If he was not a master’s slave for
good and all, he would be passing from master to master, ever freshly
reminded of the fact that his daily necessities subjected him to the
will of others, nullifying his freeman’s power of self-disposal. If he
worked side by side with slaves, there was a further grievance. For
the slave, in whom his owner had sunk capital, had to be kept fed and
housed to retard his depreciation: the free labourer depended<a id="FNanchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">[1804]</a> on his
wage, liable to fail. The situation, thus crudely stated, was intolerable.
In practice it was met, first by devotion to handicrafts as a means of
livelihood in which the winning of custom by skill relieved the worker
from direct dependence on a single master; but also by allotments of
land in annexed territory, and sometimes (as at Athens) by multiplication
of paid state-employments.</p>

<p>Of ordinary artisans, as distinct from artists, it may be said that
their position varied according as their special trades were more or less
esteemed by contemporary sentiment. The successful could and did
employ<a id="FNanchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">[1805]</a> helpers, usually slaves. In urban populations they were an
important element, particularly in those where military considerations
were not predominant. The accumulation of capital, and the introduction
of industries on a larger scale in factory-workshops with staffs of
slaves, may have affected some trades to their disadvantage, but on
the whole the small-scale craftsmen seem generally<a id="FNanchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">[1806]</a> to have held their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
ground. Unskilled labour on the other hand was generally despised.
It was as a matter of course chiefly performed by slaves. If a citizen
was compelled by want to hire out his bodily strength, this was not
voluntary: complete submission to another’s will, even for a short time,
made the relation on his part virtually servile. Accordingly philosophers,
when they came to discuss such topics, came to the conclusion
that the need of such unskilled labour proved slavery to be
‘according to nature,’ a necessary appliance of human society.
When the Stoic defined a slave as a lifelong hireling, he gave
sharp expression to what had long been felt as a true analogy. For,
if the slave was a lifelong hireling, the hireling must be a temporary
slave. Romans could borrow the thought, but with them practice had
preceded theory.</p>

<p>In making comparisons between wage-earning ancient and modern
we come upon a difficulty which it is hardly possible to set aside or
overcome. A slave could be hired from his owner, just as a freeman
could be hired from himself. The difference between the two cases
would be clearly marked<a id="FNanchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">[1807]</a> in the modern world, and language would
leave no room for misunderstanding. But many passages in ancient
writers leave it quite uncertain whether the hirelings referred to are
free or slave. The point is an important one, particularly to inquirers
who attempt to estimate the relative economic efficiency of free and
slave labour. For the immediate interest of the freeman is to get
a maximum of wage for a minimum of work: the ultimate interest of
the hired slave was often to improve his own prospect of manumission.
The custom was to allow the slave to retain a small portion of his wage.
Now this stimulus to exertion was manifestly to the interest of the
employer, who may even have made it a part of his bargain with the
owner. The slave, alive to the chance of laying up a little store for the
eventual purchase of his freedom, was induced to work well in order
to be kept employed on these terms. The owner drew a steady income
from his capital sunk in slaves, and the system was thus convenient to
all parties. We may add that, by causing a slave to take thought for
his own future, this plan encouraged him to take reasonable care of
his own health, and so far retarded his progressive deterioration as an
investment; while his owner stood to recover the slave’s hoarded wage-portion
in the form of redemption-money on manumission of his worn-out
slave. There is reason to think that slave labour under these
conditions was often more efficient than free. Unhappily we have no
direct discussion of the question from ancient observers, who did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
take this point of view, though well aware of the influence of prospective
manumission in producing contentment.</p>

<p>But how far was this comparatively genial arrangement applicable
to the ruder forms of unskilled labour? Take for instance mining.
Freemen would have none of it, and the inhuman practices of exploiters
were notorious. Yet hired slaves were freely employed. Owners knew
that their slaves were likely to waste rapidly under the methods in use,
and at Athens a common stipulation was that on the expiry of a contract
the gang hired should be returned in equal number, the employer
making good the losses certain to occur in their ranks. Here we have
the mere human chattel, hopeless and helpless, never likely to receive
anything but his keep, as an engine receives its fuel and oil, but differing
in this, that he was liable to cruel punishment. Such labourers could
not work for a freedom that they had no prospect of living to enjoy.
And how about the case of agriculture? That freemen did work for
wages on farms we know, but we hear very little of them, and that
little almost entirely as helpers at certain seasons. So far as I have
been able to learn, free wage-labour did not really compete with slave
labour in agriculture: moreover the hired man might be a hired slave,
while migratory harvesters, probably freemen, appear at least in some
cases as gangs hired for the job under a ganger of their own, responsible
to the employer for their conduct and efficiency. Most significant is
the almost complete absence of evidence that rustic slaves had any
prospect of manumission. In former chapters I have commented on
this fact and noted the few faint indications of such an arrangement.
At all events the crude plantation-system, while it lasted, was a work-to-death
system, though worn-out survivors may have had a better lot
than miners, if allowed to exist as old retainers on the estate. But
cultivation by slave labour for the purpose of raising an income for the
landlord was, even in its later improved organization, a system implying
brutal callousness, if not downright cruelty. Slave stewards and overseers,
at the mercy of the master themselves, were naturally less concerned
to spare the common hands than to escape the master’s wrath.
When writers on agriculture urge that on all grounds it is wise to keep
punishments down to a minimum, the point of their advice is surely
a censure of contemporary practice.</p>

<p>Now in modern times, humanitarian considerations being assumed,
the prevailing point of view has been more and more a strictly economic
and industrial one. It has been assumed that the freedom of an individual
consists first and foremost in the freedom to dispose of his
own labour on the best available terms. And this freedom rests on
freedom to move from place to place in search of the best labour-market
from time to time. But the movement and the bargaining have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
regarded as strictly voluntary, as in a certain sense they are. The
power to migrate or emigrate with the view of ‘bettering himself’ is
conferred on the wage-earner by modern facilities for travel, and new
countries readily absorb additional labour. But experience has shewn
that free bargaining for wages is not seldom illusory, since the man of
capital can bide his time, while the poor man cannot. Still, when every
allowance has been made on this score, it is true that the modern
labourer, through freedom of movement, has far more power of self-disposal
than the wage-earner of the Greco-Roman world. That his
position is strengthened and assured by the possession of political
power, is not without ancient analogies: but a difference in degree if
not in kind is created by the wide extension of the franchise in modern
states, and its complete separation in principle from the ownership of
land. That is, the basis of citizenship is domicile: for citizen parentage
is not required, but easily supplemented<a id="FNanchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">[1808]</a> by legal nationalization.
Moreover, religion is no longer a necessary family inheritance, but the
choice of individuals who can generally gratify their preferential sentiments
in surroundings other than their birthplace. Compare this position
with the narrow franchises of antiquity and their ineffectiveness on any
large scale, their normally hereditary character, the local and domestic
limitation of religious ties, the restricted facilities for travel, not to
mention its ever-present perils. Remember that to reside in another
state as an alien did not, in default of special treaty or act of legislative
grace, give the resident any claim to civic rights in his place of residence,
while misfortune might at any time reduce him to slavery in a foreign
land. Surely under such conditions the limits of purely voluntary action
were narrow indeed. The lure of the wage and the fear of unemployment
are often a severe form of pressure, but they are, as fetters on
freedom, a mere nothing in comparison with this.</p>

<p>Considerations such as those set forth in the preceding paragraphs
shew that in treating of ancient agriculture and farm-labour we are
apparently faced by a curious paradox. Cultivation of land (including
the keeping of live stock) is an honourable pursuit. That good health,
sustenance, even comfort and profit, are its natural attendants, is not
doubted. But the position of the labouring hands is painful and mean,
so much so that a common punishment for urban house-slaves was to
send them to work on a farm. The rustic slave’s lot differed for the
better from that of the mine-slave in the healthier nature of the occupation,
but in little else. And this degradation inevitably reacted on
the estimate of rustic wage-earners, whenever employed. There may
have been less repugnance to work side by side with slaves than has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
been felt in modern times, when a marked colour-line implied the disgrace
of a ‘white’ man doing ‘niggers’ work.’ But it is not to be
doubted that in agriculture as in other occupations the presence of
slavery did degrade labour, at all events so soon as agriculture put on
anything of an industrial character. The really ‘respectable’ person
was the man who directed the operations, the γεωργός, <i>agricola</i>, or
<i>colonus</i> (in the original sense): he was the man who worked the land
and made it yield crops, whether he took part in the actual digging
and ploughing or not. The larger the scale, the more he confined himself
to direction, necessarily; but he was the producer, a pillar of public
economy, none the less. He had provided the labour, bought or hired;
in effect, the labour was his own. With the toiling yeoman farmer of
tradition he had this in common, that both worked for themselves,
not for another. And this position, attractive in all societies, was
marked out with peculiar distinctness through the institution of slavery
underlying the social fabric. Exploitation of man by man, the first
beginnings of which elude our search and are only ascertained by inference,
suggests some sort of superiority in the upper party. At all
events the master, the man who has the upper hand, gets the credit of
achievement, and in agriculture as elsewhere the subordinate operative
is inevitably forgotten. It is from this point of view that we must regard
the fine Roman legends of sturdy farmer-citizens, the fathers of the
Republic. They are idylls conveying truth, dressed up by the imagination
of a later age: and have their place in the region where history
and poetry meet and blend. We must not gather from them that slavery
was exceptional or a fact of no importance. Tradition habitually ignores
what is normal and therefore assumed. The fairer inference is
that, as I have already remarked, slavery was in those early days still
a family institution, not an industrial system.</p>

<p>Some help towards the understanding of the different position of
manual labour in ancient times as compared with modern may be got
by considering Abolitionism. That a slave is a man, and as such not
to be wholly ignored in respect of the claims of common humanity;
that slave-labour is listless and ineffective, giving poor returns in proportion
to the strength employed; these conclusions, moral and economic,
were reached by the thinkers of the ancient world while their
civilization was in full bloom. Why then do we find no movement
corresponding to the Abolitionism of modern times? Two things were
obviously necessary for such a movement; the motive to inspire it,
and the force to give effect to it. Let men once be convinced that
slavery is both wrong and unprofitable, and let them have the power
to insist on putting an end to it, Abolitionism in some form or other
is the necessary result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span></p>

<p>Now in speaking of ancient conditions we must never lose sight of
the fact that in its origin slavery was a favour. By the undissembled
rule of force the conquered only retained his life through the mercy of
the conqueror. By a contract tacit or expressed he was pledged for
life to the service and profit of his master. And the master could, if
his interest pointed that way, make over his rights to a third party.
Hence the growth of a slave-market, and the relation of master and
slave no longer was normally that of individual conqueror and conquered.
But the original notion was by no means extinct, and it
continued to colour the current view of slavery as ‘natural,’ a thing of
course, an unquestioned social fact. Nor was there anything in the
condition of the slave to arouse a feeling of horror, so long as patriarchal
rule prevailed. If the Head of the family possessed absolute power
over the slave, his power over members of the family in general was
in kind the same. The bondman, a humble dependant rather than
a mere chattel, was in a sense also a member of the family and under
the protection of the household gods. What was there for an observer,
let him be ever so kind-hearted, to object to? Accordingly, as the
state developed, it too kept slaves of its own, employing them in mean
functions for which it was needful to have a staff always at hand. In
short, the institution was taken for granted, and growing intercourse
with foreigners only served to reveal its universal prevalence.</p>

<p>How came it then that in course of time humanitarian scruples
arose, and questioners were found to argue that the system was ‘unnatural’
and wrong? The answer must be sought in the application
of an originally domestic institution to industrial ends. Once the stage
was reached at which the products of labour were habitually put on
the market, and the producer got his living by their regular sale, it
was soon discovered that to produce and deal on a larger scale was
more economical, and therefore more profitable, than on a smaller one.
In the handicrafts this was so obvious that slave assistants were commonly
kept by tradesmen: it was important to be sure of having the
necessary help when wanted. The same was the case in the professions
based on special training: the surgeon, the architect, the surveyor, the
banker, employed slave subordinates, and had often been slaves themselves.
In all these departments, not to mention domestic service, the
position of the slave was affected by two important considerations.
First, he was one of a few, and under immediate observation, so that
escape from servitude was practically impossible. Secondly, there was
a reasonable chance of earning manumission by long faithful service.
But there were occupations in which it was far more difficult to reconcile
the interests of the slave with those of the master. Such were the
exploitation of mines and quarries, in which labour was simply applied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
in the form of brute force under direction. The direction, usually entrusted
to slave or freedman overseers, was generally unsympathetic,
sometimes cruel; for the overseer’s first thought was to please his
master, even if he could only do so by working the slaves to death.
The extension of agriculture as a means of profit rather than subsistence
created conditions of the same kind in this occupation. It was here
that the monstrous abuses incidental to slavery were most strikingly
displayed. For, while quarries and mines were only worked in a few
localities, the plan of working great landed estates by the labour of
slave-gangs was applicable to vast areas of the best soil. And in Africa
Sicily and Italy we find it so applied for the profit of the nobles and
capitalists of a conquering race.</p>

<p>The evils of this system may be set down to the account of obsequious
stewards heartlessly wringing profit for their masters out of human
flesh and blood. But we must not ignore two considerations which
suggest that the root of the evil lay not in the caprice or greed of individuals
but in the attempt to carry on rural industry by slave labour
at all. In the country, opportunities of escape were many; the slave-prison
and the fetters could hardly be dispensed with if you meant
to keep your farm-hands at disposal. And manumission, as a means
of encouraging good service, was evidently not of much avail in country
places. For after long years of exhausting labour the worn-out slave
would be unable to earn a living by hard bodily work; and he knew
no other. He had been bought as a flesh-and-blood machine; as such,
to manumit him while still efficient would be a sacrifice of sunk capital
for which nobody was prepared. It seems that the ordinary practice
was to keep him at work till he could work no longer, and then to let
him linger on the estate as an invalid retainer, feeding on what he
could get and decaying in peace. But the industrializing of agriculture,
heartlessly selfish in its aims, tempted landlords to shirk the unprofitable
maintenance of spent labourers. When a slave was no longer worth
his keep, it might pay to sell him at once for what he would fetch.
There was thus a mouth less to be fed, and the problem of how to turn
the remnant of his strength to account was shifted on to his new owner.
This plan, approved by the elder Cato as a detail of farm-economy,
marks the change of relations between master and slave in rustic life.
The old domestic relation has disappeared in the brutal exploitation
of a human animal for immediate profit. The crudely industrial system
reproduced on great estates the horrid phenomena of the quarry and
the mine.</p>

<p>That humane and thoughtful men should be disgusted with such
doings was inevitable, and disgust was soon reinforced by reasonable
alarm. For tillage was not the sole occupation of rustic enterprise. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
was found that in many districts grazing paid better than tillage, and
the two could be worked together remuneratively on a large scale. The
charge of flocks and herds, shifting their pasture according to seasons,
led to employment of able-bodied slaves in a duty responsible and at
the same time removed from immediate control for months together.
These slave herdsmen, hardy and used to a free life in wild uplands,
had to face wolves and robbers, and therefore to bear arms. We need
not dwell on the danger from such a class menacing the peace of
a country unprotected by rural police. It was real enough. Being
slaves, they had nothing but their lives to lose, and their lives it was
their owners’ interest to protect. Meanwhile the unescorted traveller
was at their mercy, and any peasants within reach would pay blackmail
to escape their raids. Yet nothing was done to get rid of the
nuisance and peril of this state of things. Servile risings were clumsily
put down with appalling bloodshed, and left to recur. Meanwhile the
free population of the countryside diminished, and prosperity could
not be restored by new slave-gangs. Such was notoriously the condition
of a great part of rural Italy under the later Republic, and contemporary
evidence clearly shews that the improvement effected under the Empire
was slight.</p>

<p>Now, when experience had proved the blighting influence of slavery,
why was there no movement to do away with the system altogether?
Truth is, there was at present no basis to start from. The moral enthusiasm,
often sincere, that has inspired such movements in modern
times, had no effective existence. Moral considerations were almost
entirely confined to a section of rich or cultivated society. It was not
expected that the common herd should rise above the meanest motives
of crude self-interest. The artisan, who either employed, or hoped soon
to employ, a slave or two, was not likely to condemn slavery: the
parasitic loafer was not likely to welcome a mass of new competitors
for the doles and bribes that he undeservedly enjoyed. During the last
century of the Roman Republic no opposition to slavery as an institution
could have arisen from the urban populace. And the wealthier
classes were interested in slavery. Religion did not touch the question.
A few scrupulous and thoughtful men might have supported an anti-slavery
movement, had there been one; but we have not the smallest
reason to think that any individual ever dreamt of starting humanitarian
propaganda on his own account and at his own risk. There was no
place in the ancient world for the reformer of this type. Even those
leaders whose policy offered advantages to the free masses, such as the
Gracchi or some Spartan kings, did not so fare in their enterprises as
to encourage imitation. As for appealing to the slaves themselves, it
was only desperate adventurers who did so, and that only to use their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
force in promoting criminal designs. Such cases only served to justify
the cruel execution of cruel laws for protecting masters and the state
in general from the imminent slave-peril. If we turn from the city, in
which what passed for politics ran its troubled and futile course, to the
countryside, we are at once in a scene from which all political life had
departed. The farmer-citizens grew fewer and fewer, and the great
majority of them were virtually disfranchised by distance. Nor were
they likely to favour any movement that seemed to be for the benefit
of slaves.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Empire did not, indeed could not, produce
any material change in the way of arousing effective sentiment hostile
to slavery. But it did much to promote internal order and far-reaching
peace. Under the new model of government the corrupt circles of
nobles and greedy capitalists were no longer in absolute control of the
civilized world, and it might seem that there was now some chance of
dealing with the canker of slavery. But no such movement was the
result. Old notions remained in full vigour. Augustus had his hands
too full, and the need of conciliating private interests was too pressing,
for him to disturb them, even had he been minded to do so. And who
else could take the initiative? But the fate of two moral influences is
worth noting. Stoicism, the creed of not a few ardent spirits, might
profess to rise superior to worldly distinctions and advantages and
assert the potential dignity of man even in the humblest condition of
life. But it was always a creed of the few: its aloofness, tending to
a certain arrogance, made it unfitted<a id="FNanchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">[1809]</a> to lead a great reform: it neither
would nor could furnish the machinery of zealous propaganda. In the
earlier Empire we find it politically allied with malcontent cliques in
which smouldering resentment at the restraints on ‘freedom’ expressed
itself by idealizing the Republic and hoping for a reaction. Thus it
lost itself in impracticable dreams, and the hand of emperors under
provocation sometimes fell heavily on its most virtuous men. The
spread of Christianity came later, and was not diverted from its aims
by a social affinity with the upper classes. Slaves bore no small part
in its expansion to the West, and it was free to operate steadily as
a humanitarian influence. But its claim to universality naturally exposed
it to grave suspicion in a world that knew religion only as an
affair of each several community, with a sort of overlordship vested in
the conquering gods of Rome. Though it was a Church and not
a philosophic system, though meant for all mankind and not for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
cultivated few, it could only win its way by accepting civilization<a id="FNanchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">[1810]</a> in
the main as it stood. Therefore it was compelled to accept slavery as
an institution, and to content itself with inculcating humanity on masters
and conscientious devotion to duty on slaves. If Abolitionism was to
spring from this seed, a long time had to be spent in waiting for the
harvest.</p>

<p>Yet the establishment of the Empire did lead to effects that in
their turn served as contributory causes undermining the old slave-system,
particularly<a id="FNanchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">[1811]</a> in agriculture. In a more peaceful age fewer slaves
were brought to market, and this meant higher prices and put a premium
on the economical employment of bought labour. To meet the
situation, agricultural policy was developed on two lines, each of which
was the improvement or extension of an existing practice. One was
the more scientific organization of the labour-staff, so as to get better
results from an equal amount of labour. The other was a more frequent
resort to the plan of letting farms to tenants, whenever that arrangement
seemed favourable to the landlord’s interest. Of these developments
we have direct information from Columella, who still prefers the
former plan wherever feasible. But it was with the system of tenancies
on various conditions that the future really lay. I have endeavoured
above to sketch the process<a id="FNanchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">[1812]</a> by which tenants were gradually reduced
to a condition of dependency on their landlords, and the difficulty of
finding and keeping good tenants that was the other side of the movement.
A very significant detail is the fact that slaves were put
into farms<a id="FNanchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">[1813]</a> as tenants: that this was no unusual practice is clear from
the way in which the classical jurists refer to it as a matter of course.
And so things slowly moved on, with ups and downs, the tenants slave
or free becoming more and more bondsmen of the land, liable to task-services
and not free to move at will. Thus by usage, and eventually
by law, a system of serfdom was established, while personal slavery
declined.</p>

<p>Looked at from an Abolitionist point of view, we are here dealing
with a sheer evasion of the slavery-question. But this was inevitable.
The imperial government, which alone had the power necessary for
attempting solutions of grave problems, was doomed to become more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
and more mechanical. Under great strains in the third century it lost
its vital forces to such a degree that it was powerless for internal
betterment. The later despotic Empire, seeing the failure of past policy,
could find no better way than to do as before<a id="FNanchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">[1814]</a>, only more mechanically
and more thoroughly. What little of freedom of movement and of self-disposal
still remained to the toiling classes accordingly disappeared.
Once a certain number had been slaves; now none were practically
free. Diminution of personal slavery had not increased personal freedom.
The attempt to confine all labour to fixed grooves and rigid rules
was a last desperate effort to control and employ the resources of
ancient civilization, in the hope of thus finding means sufficient to
endure the ever-growing strain upon the empire. This system might
serve its purpose for the moment, but it was a vain device, killing enterprise
and working out its own ruin through its own stagnation. In
agriculture, on which the whole fabric rested, its effects were particularly
ruinous: for in no occupation is there greater need of constant
forethought and loving care, which the prospect of private advantage
alone can guarantee. All these phenomena may assure us that as yet
there was no clear understanding of the value of free self-disposal as
the economic basis of society. From the moral point of view no genuine
progress was to be looked for in a stagnant age. The transition from
normal slavery to gild-bondage and normal land-serfdom does not seem
to have been affected by the spiritual levelling of Christianity. But
that as she gained power, the Church did something to mitigate<a id="FNanchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">[1815]</a> the
hardness of the time, is not to be doubted.</p>

<p>I need not dwell at length on the contrast presented by modern
anti-slavery movements. The influence of religion, personal and humanitarian,
is alone enough to account for the new spirit aroused and
organized by Clarkson and Wilberforce. To put down the slave-trade
because it was wrong was a momentous step, and emancipation its
inevitable corollary, costly though it might be. That the reform was
carried out two generations before the handworking masses of England
gained political power is a most notable fact. For it is not possible to
connect the achievement with the natural jealousy of free labour
objecting to competition of slave labour. In the United States the
motives for Abolition were necessarily more mixed, but sincere fanatics,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
religious and violent, were the leaders of the crusade. But the repugnance
of free labour to the recognition of slavery in any part of the
Republic (and it was this sentiment that furnished the necessary voting-power)
was not so purely philanthropic. Students of American history
are well aware of the moral change brought about by a single mechanical
invention in the southern states. The economic advantages
of the cotton-gin made slavery so profitable that existing tendencies
towards emancipation died out in the South. A new life was given to
a confessed evil, and the developed plantation-system, industrialized
for the profit of a few, went down the road of fate to end in tragedy.
The result of the great civil war at all events settled one question.
Henceforth labour was to stand on a footing of self-disposal and wage-earning,
with freedom to improve its conditions on those lines. The
solution, obtained at an awful cost, was final for the time: what will
be its ultimate outcome is at present (1919) a matter of some doubt,
for reasons not to be discussed here.</p>

<p>The fact that Abolitionism is a phenomenon of the modern<a id="FNanchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">[1816]</a> world,
and not of the ancient, will not seem insignificant to those who have
read widely in the ancient writers and remarked how very little we
hear of free wage-earning labour. If we deduct the references to independent
artisans practising trades on a small scale (and their cases
are not relevant here), what we hear of mere wage-earners is very little
indeed. And of this little again only a part concerns agriculture.
I take it that we may fairly draw one conclusion from this: the wishes
of the free wage-earning class, whatever their numbers may have been,
were practically of no account in the ancient world. From first to last
the primitive law of superior force, the ‘good old rule’ of which slavery
was a product, was tacitly accepted. Civilization might undergo
changes of character, periods of peace might alternate with periods of
war: still bondage and labour were closely connected in men’s minds,
and honest labour as such commanded no respect. How could it? Of
a golden age, in which all men were free and slavery unknown, we have
nothing that can be called evidence. The curtain rises on a world in
which one man is at the full disposal of another. What is at first a
small domestic matter contains the germ of later developments; and
in the case of agriculture we see clearly how demands of an industrial
nature transformed single bond-service into the wholesale and brutal
exploitation of human chattels in slave-gangs. We have no good
reason to believe that men ever in the ancient world abstained from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
employing slave labour out of humanitarian scruples. Scarcity of slaves,
or lack of means to buy them, were certainly the main restrictive influences.
The institution was always there, ready for extension and
adaptation as changing conditions might suggest. If ancient civilization
did not rest on a basis of slavery, on what did it rest? Assuredly not
on free self-disposal. The man free to dispose of himself claimed the
right to dispose of others, up to the limits of his own power and will.
In this there is nothing wonderful. We need not flatter ourselves that
the rule of force is now extinct. True, personal bondage to individuals
is forbidden by law, but effective freedom of self-disposal, perhaps an
impossible dream, is not yet realized: only its absence is dissembled
under modern forms.</p>

<p>When I say that ancient civilization rested on a basis of slavery,
the condition present to my mind is this. A social and political structure
requires for its stability a reasonably sound economic foundation. This
foundation is found in the assured and regular use of natural resources.
And this use implies the constant presence of an obedient labour-force
that can be set to work and kept working as and when needed. This
force is now more and more supplied by machinery, the drudge that
cannot strike. Antiquity made the slave its quasi-mechanical drudge:
the more or less of slavery at a given moment simply depended on
circumstances.</p>

<p>In returning to my original questions, whether the growth of Greco-Roman
civilization was in fact achieved through the system of slavery,
and whether it could conceivably have been accomplished without
slavery, I have I think given my answer to the first, that is, so far as
agriculture is concerned. And agriculture was the vital industry, on
which the whole fabric principally rested. As to the second question,
I can give no satisfactory answer. For my part, I agree with those
who hold that, in the conditions of antiquity as depicted in our traditions
and inferred by modern inquirers, slavery in some form and degree
was an indispensable condition of progress. States, organizations of a
lasting kind, had to be established by force. Captive labour, added to
the resources of conquerors, seems to be a powerful means of increasing
their economic strength and abridging the wasteful periods of conflict.
But, once the stage had been reached at which a state was sufficiently
stable and strong to provide for order within and to repel invaders, a
slave-system became a canker, economic, social, ultimately political.
I believe that the maladies from which the old Greco-Roman civilization
suffered, and which in the end brought about its decay and fall,
were indirectly or directly due to this taint more than to any other
cause. I know of no case ancient or modern in which a people have
attained to a sound and lasting prosperity by exploiting the servitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
of other men. Serfdom or slavery, it matters not. So far as human
experience has gone, it appears that all such conditions are eventually
ruinous<a id="FNanchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">[1817]</a> to the rulers.</p>

<p>For it is not merely the degradation of manual labour that results
from slavery. The deadening of inventive genius and economic improvements
is fatally promoted through the tendency to remedy all
shortcomings by simply using up more flesh and blood. Man abdicates
a most important function of his reason, and accepts a mere superiority
of animal over animal. This is surely not following the true law of his
development. It is from this point of view that the great scientific inventions
of modern times present an encouraging spectacle, as the
earlier abuses of their exploitation are gradually overcome, and the
operative citizen vindicates his claims as a human being. That ancient
slavery did in some ways act for good by guaranteeing leisure to classes
some of whom employed it well, may be freely admitted. But I do not
think we can sincerely extend the admission to include the case of
Politics, whatever Greek philosophers may have thought. Nor can we
without reservations apply it in the field of Art. On the other hand
Literature surely owed much to the artificial leisure created by slavery.
Even in its most natural utterances Greco-Roman literature is the voice
of classes privileged because free, not restrained by the cramping influences
of workaday life and needs. Its partisan spirit is the spirit of
the upper strata of society, ignoring the feelings, and often the existence,
of the unfree toilers below. In the main aristocratic, it tells us next to
nothing of the real sentiments of even the free masses, particularly on
the labour-questions that have now for some time increasingly occupied
the public mind. That we are, for good or for evil, viewing all
matters of human interest on a different plane from that of the ‘classic’
writers, is a consideration that students of the Past are in duty bound
never to forget.</p>

<p>But, when we are told<a id="FNanchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">[1818]</a> that ancient civilization in its early stages
(as seen in the Homeric poems etc) may fairly be labelled as Medieval,
while it may be called Modern when in its full bloom, we shall do well
to pause before accepting a dogma that may imply more than we are
prepared to grant. That mankind had to make a fresh start in the
Middle Ages, ancient civilization having run its course and failed, is a
proposition dangerously true. If it implies that the ‘free’ labour of
modern times is not a direct development from ancient slavery, so
far good. If we are to hold that ancient slave labour and modern free
labour, when and so far as each is a factor of economic importance, are
practically identical phenomena of capitalism eager to make a profit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
out of cheap labour, we may ask—is the parallelism so exact as it is
thus represented to be? When we are told that the capitalist would
nowadays prefer to employ slave labour if it were to be had, and that
the legal form in which labour is supplied is a secondary consideration
from the economic point of view, we begin to hesitate: is this really
true? Was not the ineffectiveness of slave labour detected in ancient
times? Was it not proved to demonstration in America, as attested by
the evidence of both Northern and Southern witnesses? To reply that
what capital wants is not mere slave labour but efficient slave labour,
would be no answer. Capital is not, and never was, blind to the inefficiency
of slave labour as compared with free labour. In the pursuit
of profit it needs a supply of labour at its immediate and certain disposal;
therefore it takes what it can get. In the ancient world the
unquestioned institution of slavery offered a source of supply, not ideal,
but such as could be relied on. Therefore capital employed slavery to
extend its operations, simply turning existing conditions to account.
And the admission, that the most flourishing period of Greco-Roman
civilization was also the period in which slavery reached its greatest
development, is surely a virtual denial that the basis of that civilization
was free labour. That is, free wage-earning labour. For the independent
farmer or artisan had nothing to do with the matter: he
worked for himself, not for another, and was on a different plane
from either wage-earner or slave. If he did not employ either wage-earner
or slave, it was because he found such help too costly or a
doubtful boon.</p>

<p>The case of agriculture at once reveals what was found to be the
strong point of slave labour, the feasibility of employing it in large
masses. Much of the work consisted in the mere mechanical use of
brute force, and one overseer could direct many hands. In operations
dependent on the seasons, the labour must be at hand to utilize opportunities.
The choice lay between slaves not working with a will
and free wage-earners not likely to be on the spot when wanted. Why
were slaves preferred? Because their presence in sufficient number
could be relied on in the existing conditions of the world. The history
of industrial agriculture was a long tale of effort so to organize slave
labour as to get out of it the greatest possible margin of profit. Not
that slavery was thought preferable in itself; but a means of wholesale
cultivation had to be found, and the then available resources of civilization
offered no other. When the supply of slaves began to fail, landlords
sought a remedy in letting some or all of their land to tenant farmers
(extending an old practice), not in attempting to farm on their own
account with hired labour. Hired labour remained as before, an occasional
appliance to meet temporary needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span></p>

<p>The use of the terms Medieval and Modern as labels<a id="FNanchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">[1819]</a> for ancient
civilization in two clearly marked stages has, I repeat, just enough
truth in it to be dangerous. As a rhetorical flourish it may pass. But
it conveys by suggestion much that cannot be accepted. No doubt it
is not meant to imply that what we call the Middle Ages is to be
ignored. But it inevitably tends to stifle a belief in historical continuity,
a faith in which is the soul of historical inquiry as generally understood
in the present day. That modern labour-conditions shew a powerful
reaction against medieval, is obvious: that medieval conditions have
not influenced the modes of this reaction, is to me incredible. I do not
believe that the modern free wage-earning system could have grown
out of the ancient slave-labour system, had there been no such intervening
period as the ‘Middle Ages.’ That the aims of the capitalist
ancient and modern are the same, is a mere truism: but is not the
same true of the medieval capitalist also?</p>

<p>That the wage-earning handworker often finds his freedom of self-disposal
limited in practice, though his position is very far removed
from slavery, I have pointed out above. Also, that modern facilities
for movement have helped materially to assert and enlarge his freedom.
From this point of view the discovery of the New World was the
turning-point of European history. But in course of time capitalistic
phenomena appeared there also, and on a larger scale. And now,
almost the whole world over, the handworker is striving, not only for
higher wages but for more complete self-disposal. This necessitates
some control of the industries in which he works. Individual effort
being vain, he forms unions to guard his interests. The unions, acting
by strike-pressure, come into conflict with governments representing
the state. The next step is to employ political pressure by gaining
and using votes under representative systems, so as to remodel legislation
and administration in a sense favourable to the handworker. This
movement, now well under way in the most civilized countries, is not
perhaps socialistic in principle, and we do not yet know how far it is
likely to take that turn. In order to fight exploitation, the handworker
has to surrender a good deal of his individual freedom: whether he
will be content to surrender a good deal more, the coming age will see.
This much at least is clear,—the handworking wage-earners are no
longer, as in the ancient world, a class of no account. That they have
wrung so many great concessions from unwilling capitalists seems to
me a proof that their freedom, even under medieval<a id="FNanchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">[1820]</a> restrictions, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
always in it something real, some quality that sharply distinguished
it from ancient slavery. In ancient slavery I can see no germ out of
which betterment of labour-conditions could conceivably arise. It
simply had to die, and modern attempts to revive it have had to
die also.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages I have recognized two lines of distinction.
One is that commonly admitted, the line that parts freeman from slave.
The other is that between free wage-earner and slave. In looking back
from modern circumstances to ancient, the latter is much the more
important. For, now that slavery in the proper sense has been abolished
by modern civilized peoples, the conditions of wage-earning stand out
as presenting the most momentous issues of the present age. To the
statesmen the questions raised are full of anxiety as to the probable
influence of present policies on future wellbeing. A student of Greco-Roman
civilization must ask himself whether modern labour-questions
and their attempted solutions may not indirectly furnish help in appraising
and judging the conditions of the past. Now it so happens
that in the case of agriculture recent events in Russia possess very
marked significance, and it is therefore hardly possible to leave them
unnoticed here.</p>

<p>It seems to be established<a id="FNanchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">[1821]</a> beyond reasonable doubt that the genuine
and effective doctrine of Leninite Bolshevism, in its definition of the
‘working class,’ excludes the peasantry. They are not ‘proletarian.’
That is, the great majority of peasants have something. This each
wants to keep, and if possible to augment. In short, they are Individualists.
Now Bolshevism builds on dogmas of Marxian Socialism,
however much it may warp their application, however widely it may
depart from Marxian theory in its choice of methods. Therefore it
sees in the peasants only a class of petty bourgeoisie with the anti-socialistic
instincts of that hated class, and will spare no effort to exclude
them from political power. It disfranchises employers, even though
the work they do is productive and useful to society. We need go no
further: these principles of the Bolshevik creed, be it prophetic vision
or be it crazy fanaticism blind to the facts of human nature and devoid
of all practical sense of proportion, are enough for my present purpose.
It results from them that all wage-earning is wrong: no man
has the right to employ another man for his own purposes: that
the relation benefits both employer and employed, even if true, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
consideration<a id="FNanchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">[1822]</a> wholly irrelevant. For it is promised that the new
civilization, recast on the Bolshevik model, will leave no room for
wage-service of one man to another.</p>

<p>I am not to criticize this scheme of social and economic life, but
to look at it coolly as an illustrative fact. It is surely a significant
thing that, while slavery and serfdom are now reckoned as virtually
obsolete phenomena of the past, the old distinction, between the man
who works himself for himself and the man who works for another, is
still before us as the vital line of division in labour-questions. Bloodshed
and torture as means of enforcing the dogma may be confined to
Russia, but the distinction is at the bottom of industrial unrest all over
the world. Most significant of all is the admission that peasant landholders
are not a ‘proletariate.’ Of course they are not. But to philosophers
and statesmen of antiquity they appeared as an all-important
class, not only as producers of food but as a solid element of population,
promoting the stability of state governments. This stability was favourable
to continuity of policy and enabled all interests to thrive in peace.
Have the development of machinery and transport in recent times so
far altered the conditions of agriculture that this is no longer the case?
In other words, is the agricultural labourer, the present wage-earner,
to supersede the peasant landholder as the dominant figure of rustic
life? Is the large-scale farmer to survive only as the impotent figurehead
of rural enterprises? Is a political proletariate competent to
regulate the conduct of an industry directly dependent on soil climate
and seasons? Wherever man is in immediate contact with forces of
nature, in farm-life as in seafaring, the bodily energies of many can
only be effective through subordination to the mind of one. How far,
under the modern factory system, where the mill goes on as usual in
all weathers, direction by wage-earners may be a practicable proposition,
I cannot tell. That such a plan would be a failure on a farm,
I have no doubt whatever.</p>

<p>My general conclusion then is that the old distinction observable
under Greco-Roman civilization was in itself a sound one. Yet it led
to no lasting and satisfactory solution of agricultural labour-problems.
Many causes no doubt contributed to this failure; but the lack of
a satisfactory labour-system was probably the greatest. Neither slavery
nor serfdom was capable of meeting the need, and the wage-earning
system never grew so as efficiently to supersede them. Now, after
centuries of the wage-system, we are uneasily asking ourselves whether
modern civilization is gravely endangered through the failure of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
system also. It seems that in agriculture at least there are two possible
alternatives, either a final settlement of the wage-question on a footing
satisfactory to the labourer, or a return to αὐτουργία. Probably neither
of these will be found to exclude the other or to be equally applicable
to the circumstances of all countries. That communal ownership and
shifting tenure can be revived seems impossible under modern conditions,
whatever some Socialists may fancy. On the other hand
voluntary cooperation in marketing seems to have a great future before
it. Of a movement in that direction I have found no traces among
the ancients: but modern developments in the way of transport may
remove many difficulties. At any rate it is in such efforts of adaptation
and compromise that expert agriculturists seem to be looking for help.
As to labour, slavery and serfdom being excluded from modern civilized
states, the coming problem is how to secure the performance of agricultural
work. The choice lies between attractive wage-conditions,
appealing to individual interest, and the Socialist scheme of tasks
carried out under official direction, assumed to be in the best interests
of a whole community. Both plans offer a substitute for the crude
compulsory methods vainly employed in the ancient world. Which
plan is the more suited to the demands of human nature, whether self-disposal
or communism is to be the dominant aim and note of society,
coming generations must decide.</p>

<p>To follow up the history of agricultural labour under the so-called Byzantine
empire, after the Roman empire had fallen in the West, is beyond my
scope. Yet there are certain matters on which light is thrown by surviving
documents that it is hardly possible wholly to ignore. That the position of the
agricultural classes did not follow the same lines of development in East and
West, is in itself a fact worth noting, though not surprising. It may be said to
run parallel with the general fate of the two sections of the once Roman world.
In the West<a id="FNanchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">[1823]</a> the growth of what we call Feudalism and the rise of new nation-states
are the phenomena that in the course of centuries gradually produced
our modern Europe. In the East the Empire long preserved its organization,
declining in efficiency and power, but rallying again and again, serving as a
bulwark of Christian Europe, and not extinguished finally till 1453. It might
perhaps have been guessed that the conditions of rustic life would undergo
some change, for the system of the later Roman colonate was already shewing
signs of coming failure in the time of Arcadius and Honorius. The need of
some system more favourable to individual energy and enterprise, more to be
trusted for production of food, was surely not to be ignored. Food must have
been a need of extreme urgency, with armies constantly engaged in northern
or eastern wars, and the mouths of Constantinople ever hungry at home.
After the Saracen conquest of Egypt in the seventh century, the food-resources
on which the government could rely must have been seriously reduced, and
the need greater than ever. Thus we are not to wonder if we find indications
of great interest taken in agriculture, and direct evidence of reversion to a
better land-system than that of the later Roman colonate.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_A">A. GEOPONICA.</h3>

<p>The curious collection known as <b>Geoponica</b><a id="FNanchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">[1824]</a> comes down to us in a text
attributed to the tenth century, which is supposed to be a badly-edited version
of an earlier work probably of the sixth or early seventh century. It is in a scrap-book
form, consisting of precepts on a vast number of topics, the matter under
each heading being professedly drawn from the doctrine of some author or
authors whose names are prefixed. Some of these are Byzantine writers, others
of much earlier date, including Democritus and Hippocrates, and the Roman
Varro. Modern critics consider these citations of names untrustworthy, the collector
or editor having dealt very carelessly with the work of his predecessors. I can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
only say that an examination of the chapters that are of special interest to me
fully bears out this censure. I would add that a reference to the index shews
that Cato Columella Pliny (elder) and Palladius are never cited, and express
my suspicion that the omission of names is not always a proof that those
authors were disregarded as sources. The general character of the work is
unscientific and feeble, abounding in quackery and superstition. Technical
and dogmatic, it has nevertheless an air of unreality, perhaps due in part to
the later editor, but probably in part to the original compiler, whose name is
given as Cassianus Bassus, a lawyer (σχολαστικός), apparently a Byzantine.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that the cultivation of corn fills but a small space in
the Geoponica, being evidently quite a subordinate department of farm-life as
there contemplated. Is this an indication that Constantinople was still drawing
plenty of corn from Egypt, and may we infer that this feature is due to the
original compiler, writing before the loss of that granary-province? I do not
venture to answer the question.</p>

<p>The passages interesting from my point of view occur in the second book,
where some reference, scanty and obscure though it be, is made to labour and
labourers. A chapter (2) on the classes of labourers suited for various kinds
of work is a good specimen of this unsatisfactory treatise. It is labelled
Βάρωνος, but we may well hesitate to ascribe the substance to Varro. The rules
given are for the most part quite commonplace, and I cannot trace them in
Varro’s <i>res rustica</i>. On the other hand some of them correspond to precepts
of Columella. Whether this is their real source, or whether they are traditional
rules handed down carelessly by previous compilers, perhaps on even earlier
authority, I see no sure means of determining. The doctrine that boys (παῖδες)
should be employed in field-labour (ἐργασία), to watch and learn from their
experienced elders, and the remark that their suppleness fits them better for
stooping jobs (weeding etc.), is new to me. Varro<a id="FNanchor_1825" href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">[1825]</a> at least puts the minimum
age for field-hands at 22. Perhaps this doctrine comes from some later authority,
of a time when the old supply of adult field-hands was evidently failing.</p>

<p>Another chapter, labelled as drawn from Florentinus (? first half of third
century), deals with the qualifications and duties of the ἐπίτροπος or οἰκονόμος,
the Roman <i>vilicus</i>. This chapter (44) is also quite commonplace, and can be
copiously illustrated out of many authors, from Xenophon and Cato to Columella
and Pliny. The exact meaning of one passage (§ 3) is not clear to me,
but its general drift is in agreement with the rest. The notable point about the
chapter is that it discusses the steward and his staff as forming the ordinary
establishment of a farm. Are we to infer that this system was normal at the
time when the compiler put together the precepts under this head? Or is this
a case of unintelligent compilation, a mere passing-on of doctrines practically
obsolete by a town-bred writer in his study? I cannot tell. The consideration
of further details may give some help towards a judgment.</p>

<p>The next chapter (45), with the same label, treats of the steward’s diary and
the organization of the hands (ἐργάται). The main doctrine is that every day
must have its task, and every plan be punctually carried out, since one delay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
upsets the whole course (τὴν τῆς ἐργασίας τάξιν) and is bad for both crops and
land. This again is stale enough, and may be illustrated from Cato and Columella.
The rules for organizing the hands in groups of suitable size, so as to
get a maximum of efficiency with a minimum of overseers, agree closely with
what we find in Columella. Thus there is a strong probability that the labour
intended is that of slaves.</p>

<p>In chapter 46, with same label, the subject is one of scale (περὶ μέτρου
ἐργασίας), the expression of several operations in terms of labour-units (ἐργασίαι,
<i>operae</i>). This also is an old story, capable of much illustration from earlier writers.
The work contemplated is that of a vineyard. The way in which the hands
(ἐργάται) are referred to is more suited to a slave-staff than to wage-earners.</p>

<p>So too in chapter 47, with same label. It is περὶ τῆς τῶν γεωργῶν ὑγιείας,
enjoining general care of the men’s health and prescribing remedies for various
ailments. It seems taken for granted that the hands will submit to the treatment
imposed. Remembering the traditional interest of the master in his
slaves’ health, we can hardly doubt that slaves are meant here.</p>

<p>Chapter 48, labelled as drawn from Didymus (? fourth or fifth century), is a
warning against ill-considered transplantation from better spots to less wholesome
ones. The reverse order is the right one. This rule applies not only to
plants (φυτά) but to farm-workers (γεωργόι) also. The principle can be traced
back to earlier writers. It seems assumed that the men, like the plants, can be
removed at the master’s will. Probably slaves are meant, and we may recall
the objections of Varro and Columella to risking slave-property in malarious
spots.</p>

<p>Chapter 49, labelled Βάρωνος, asserts the necessity of keeping such artisans
as smiths carpenters and potters on the farm or near at hand. The tools have
to be kept in good order, and visits to the town waste time. That this precept
comes from Varro <span class="allsmcap">I</span> 16 §§ 3, 4, seems more than doubtful: reference will shew
that the passages differ considerably.</p>

<p>I would add that the argument prefixed to book <span class="allsmcap">III</span>, a farmer’s calendar,
at least in Beckh’s text, gives a list of the months from January to December,
attaching to each Roman name the corresponding Egyptian one. The editor
apparently accepts this double list as genuine. If it be so, has the fact any
bearing on the relations between Constantinople and Egypt referred to above?</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_B">B. THE FARMER’S LAW.</h3>

<p>The so-called ‘<b>Farmer’s Law</b>,’ νόμος γεωργικός, is now assigned by the
critics to the time of the Iconoclast emperors, say about 740 <span class="allsmcap">AD</span>. It is an
official document of limited scope, not a general regulative code governing
agricultural conditions in all parts of the eastern empire. Its text origin arrangement
and the bearing of its evidence have been much discussed, and it
will suffice here to refer to the articles of Mr Ashburner<a id="FNanchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">[1826]</a>
    on the subject. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
concerns me is the position of farmers under the Byzantine empire in the eighth
century as compared with that of the fourth or fifth century <i>coloni</i>, and the
different lines of development followed by country life in East and West.
Therefore it is only necessary to consider some of the main features of the
picture revealed to us by various details of the Farmer’s Law.</p>

<p>The first point that strikes a reader is that the serf<a id="FNanchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">[1827]</a> <i>colonus</i> has apparently
disappeared. Land is held by free owners, who either themselves provide for
its cultivation or let it to tenants who take over that duty. The normal organization
is in districts (χωρία) each of which contains a number of landowners,
who either farm their own land or, if short of means (ἄποροι), let it to other
better-equipped farmers of the same district. Thus the transactions are locally
limited, and the chief object of the law is to prevent misdeeds that might prejudicially
affect the prosperity of the local farmers. These are in a sense partners
or commoners (κοινωνοί), the ‘commonalty’ (κοινότης) of the district, which is
a taxation-unit with its members jointly liable. The district seems to be regarded
as originally common and then divided into members’ lots, with a part reserved
perhaps as common pasture. Redivision is contemplated, and the lots seem
to belong rather to the family than to the individual. To judge from the tone
of the rules, it seems certain that the farmers and their families are a class
working with their own hands. But there are also wage-earning labourers, and
slaves owned or hired for farm work. Tenancy on shares, like the partiary
system in Roman Law, appears as an established practice, and in one passage
(clause 16) Mr Ashburner detects a farmer employed at a salary, in short a
<i>mercennarius</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we find existing what are a kind of village communities, the landowning
farmers in which are free to let land to each other and also to exchange
farms if they see fit to do so. How far they are free to flit from one commune
to another remains doubtful. And there is no indication that they are at
liberty to dispose of their own land-rights to outsiders. There appears however
side by side with these communal units another system of tenancies in which
individual farmers hire land from great landlords. Naturally the position of
such tenants is different from that of tenants under communal owners: the
matter is treated at some length by Mr Ashburner. What proportion the corn
crop generally bore to other produce in the agriculture of the Byzantine empire
contemplated by these regulations, the document does not enable us to judge.
Vineyards and figyards were clearly an important department, and also gardens
for vegetables and fruit. Live stock, and damage done to them and by them,
are the subject of many clauses, nor is woodland forgotten. But the olive does
not appear. So far as one may guess, the farming was probably of a mixed
character. The penalties assigned for offences are often barbarous, including
not only death by hanging or burning but blinding and other mutilations of
oriental use. At the same time the ecclesiastical spirit of the Eastern empire
finds expression in the bestowal of a curse on one guilty of cheating, referring
I suppose primarily to undiscovered fraud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span></p>

<p>The state of things inferred from the provisions of the ‘Farmer’s Law’ is
so remarkable in itself, and so different from the course of rustic development
in the West, that we are driven to seek an explanation of some kind. Many
influences may have contributed to produce so striking a differentiation. But
one can hardly help suspecting that there was some one great influence at
work in the eastern empire, to which the surprising change noted above was
mainly due. In his <i>History of the later Roman Empire</i><a id="FNanchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">[1828]</a> Professor Bury has
offered a conjectural solution of the problem. It is to be sought in the changes
brought about in the national character and the external history of the Empire.
Since the middle of the sixth century north-west Asia Minor and the Balkan
country had been filled with Slavonic settlers, and other parts with other new
colonists. Now the new settlers, particularly the Slavs, were not used to the
colonate system or the rigid bond of hereditary occupations, and emperors
busied in imperial defence on the North and East knew better than to force
upon them an unwelcome system. Invasions had reduced the populations
of frontier provinces and shattered the old state of serfdom. Resettlement
on a large scale had to be carried out within the empire, and under new
conditions to suit the changed character of the population. Among the
new elements that produced this change the most important was the coming
of the Slavs.</p>

<p>For the Slavs had themselves no institution corresponding to the German
<i>laeti</i>. Slaves indeed they had, but not free cultivators attached to the soil.
Therefore they could not, like the Germans in the West, adapt themselves to
the Roman colonate; accordingly their intrusion led to its abolition. In support
of this view the well-known Slavonic peasant communities are cited as evidence.
Nor can it be denied that this consideration has some weight. But, while we
may provisionally accept the conclusion that Slavonic influences had something,
perhaps much, to do with the new turn given to the conditions of rustic
life in the East, we must not press it so far as to infer that the colonate-system
was extinct there. In no case could the ‘Farmer’s Law’ fairly be used to prove
the negative: and moreover it is apparently the case according to Mr Ashburner
that the document is not a complete agricultural code for all agricultural classes
within the empire. If it is ‘concerned exclusively with a village community,
composed of farmers who cultivate their own lands,’ it cannot prove the non-existence
of other rustic conditions different in kind. Colonate seems to have
disappeared, while slavery has not. But that is the utmost we can say. The
slave at least is still there. As to the important question, whether the farmers
contemplated in the Law enjoy a real freedom of movement, as has been
thought, it is best to refer a reader to the cautious reserve of Mr Ashburner.</p>

<p>The one general inference that I venture to draw from these two authorities
is that, however much or little the conditions of agriculture may have changed
in the surviving Eastern part of the Roman empire, the employment of slave
labour still remained.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_C">C. EXTRACTS FROM MODERN BOOKS.</h3>

<p class="center">(1) <b>Hume</b>, Essay <span class="allsmcap">XI</span>, <i>Of the populousness of antient nations</i>.</p>

<p>We must now consider what disadvantages the antients lay under with
regard to populousness, and what checks they received from their political
maxims and institutions. There are commonly compensations in every human
condition; and tho’ these compensations be not always perfectly equal, yet
they serve, at least, to restrain the prevailing principle. To compare them and
estimate their influence, is indeed very difficult, even where they take place in
the same age, and in neighbouring countries: But where several ages have intervened,
and only scattered lights are afforded us by antient authors; what
can we do but amuse ourselves by talking, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, on an interesting
subject, and thereby correcting all hasty and violent determinations?</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Modern Italian Conditions.</span></h4>

<p class="center">(2) <b>Bolton King and Thomas Okey</b>, <i>Italy today</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Italy today</i>, Messrs <b>Bolton King and Thomas Okey</b> furnish a most
interesting collection of facts relative to Italian rural conditions. The extent
to which the phenomena of antiquity reappear in the details of this careful
treatise is most striking. Italy being the central land of my inquiry, and convinced
as I am that the great variety of local conditions is even now not sufficiently
recognized in Roman Histories, this excellent book is of peculiar value.
In the course of (say) fifteen centuries Italy and her people have passed through
strange vicissitudes, not merely political: a great change has taken place in the
range of agricultural products: yet old phenomena of rural life meet the inquirer
at every turn. Surely this cannot be dismissed lightly as a casual coincidence.
I cannot find room to set out the resemblances in detail, so I append a short
table of reference to passages in the book that have impressed me most.
Supplementary to this, as a vivid illustration of conditions in a mountain district,
the first three chapters of <i>In the Abruzzi</i>, by <b>Anne Macdonell</b>, are decidedly
helpful. For instance, it appears that the old migratory pasturage still existed
in full force down to quite recent times, but the late conversion of much
Apulian lowland from pasture to tillage has seriously affected the position of
the highland shepherds by reducing the area available for winter grazing. The
chapter on brigandage has also some instructive passages.</p>

<p>Chapters (essays) <span class="allsmcap">II</span> and <span class="allsmcap">III</span>, <i>French farming</i> and <i>Tenant-right and agrarian
outrage in France</i>, contain much of interest.</p>

to the rural population. Element of stability. The answer to agitators ‘Cela
est bien, mais il faut cultiver notre jardin.’ Difficulties which beset its artificial
creation. <i>Métayage</i> (under present conditions) has proved the best shelter for
tenant-farmers against the agricultural storm. Need of implicit confidence
between landlord and working partner.</p>

<p>pp 98-9 Tenant-right in Santerre (Picardy). Tenant considers himself a
co-proprietor of the land. Former payment of rent in kind taken to be a sign
of joint ownership. Now in money, but calculated upon market price of corn.
Landlord’s loss of control. High money value of <i>droit de marché</i>.</p>

<p>p 104 Traces of Roman occupation. Roman soldier followed by farmer.
‘Under the empire the <i>colonus</i> was not a slave, but the owner of slaves: he
held his land in perpetuity; he could not leave it. He paid a fixed rent in
kind, which could not be raised. Tenant-right therefore is explained as the
recognition by the Frankish conquerors of this hereditary claim to the perpetual
occupation of the soil.’ [One of the various explanations offered.]</p>

<p>p 119 Severe legislation failed to get rid of tenant-right, but since 1791 it
has been recognized, and so its importance decreased. Under the <i>ancien
régime</i> leases were short—9 years—and precarious. They were governed by
the Roman law maxim <i>emptori fundi necesse non est stare colonum</i>. That is, if
property changed hands during the continuance of the lease, the new owner
might evict the tenant. The <i>Code Civil</i> confirms law of 1791—dispossession
only if provision has been made (in lease) for it.</p>

<p>In general, land-tenures vary very greatly in the various provinces.</p>

Reformation</i>. Cambridge 1918.</p>

<p>In Section <span class="allsmcap">VI</span> <i>Manor and Cottage</i> are a number of extracts throwing light
on the rustic conditions of their times.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. <i>A model Manor</i> pp 301-6, describing the organization of an estate,
with the duties of the several officials and departmental servants. Watchful
diligence and economy, strict accountability and honesty are insisted on, that
the rights of the Lord may not be impaired.</p>

<p>8. <i>Decay of husbandry</i>, pp 312-14. (Sir T More.)</p>

</div>

<p>All these passages are of great interest as shewing how a number of phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
observable in the case of ancient estates are repeated under medieval
conditions. The typical Manor with its elaborate hierarchy and rules, the
struggles of the small yeoman, the encroachments of big landlords, the special
difficulties of small-scale tillage caused by growth of large-scale pasturage, the
increase of wastrels and sturdy beggars, are all notable points, worthy the
attention of a student of ancient farm life and labour.</p>

<p>‘I worked for Rockefeller most of that season. You know he has a big estate
down below here a ways. There used to be farmhouses—yes and villages
on it, but he bought the owners all out, or froze ’em out. One feller was determined
not to sell, and as a sample of how things was made uncomfortable for
him I heard tell that two men came to his house once and made him a present
of some venison. They had hardly gone when the game warden dropped in
and arrested him for havin’ venison in his house. All such tricks was worked
on him, and he spent every cent he was worth fighting lawsuits. People wa’n’t
allowed to fish on the property, and the women wa’n’t allowed to pick berries
on it. A good deal of hard feeling was stirred up, and Rockefeller would scoot
from the train to his house, and pull the curtains down, ’fraid they’d shoot
him. Oh! he was awful scairt.’</p>

from the slow sapping of vitality due to their divorce alike from the actual
tilling of the land and from trade and commerce.... He has been within the
(Balkan) peninsula a parasite, chiefly upon the ploughing peasant, and the
effect has been to implant in the mind of that peasant a passion for agriculture,
for the undisturbed possession of a patch of freehold, which is probably as
strong here as it has ever been in the world.’ p 137.</p>

<p><i>Thessaly</i>—‘the landowners are almost always absentees, appearing only at
the time of harvest’ (originally Turks, now mostly Greeks) ‘who have taken
little personal interest in the land’ (no great improvement in condition of cultivator).
(So in Bosnia—better in Serbia and Bulgaria) ‘lands mostly worked
by the peasants on the half-shares system.’ p 175.</p>

<p><i>Albania</i>—(poverty extreme—temporary emigration of the males, frequent
in poor regions) ‘young Albˢ often leave their country during the winter, going
to work in Greece or elsewhere as field labourers, and returning to their
mountains in the spring.’ pp 183-4.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_D">D. LIST OF SOME BOOKS USED.</h3>

<p>This list does not pretend to be complete. Many other works are referred
to here and there in the notes on the text. But I feel bound to mention the
names of some, particularly those dealing with conditions that did or still do
exist in the modern world. Miscellaneous reading of this kind has been to me
a great help in the endeavour to understand the full bearing of ancient evidence,
and (I hope) to judge it fairly. It is on the presentation and criticism of that
evidence that I depend: for the great handbooks of Antiquities do not help
me much. The practice of making a statement and giving in support of it a
reference or references is on the face of it sound. But, when the witnesses
cited are authors writing under widely various conditions of time and place
and personal circumstances, it is necessary whenever possible to appraise
each one separately. And when the aim is, not to write a technical treatise on
‘scientific’ lines, but to describe what is a highly important background of a
great civilization, a separate treatment of witnesses needs no apology. I cannot
cite in detail the references to conditions in a number of countries, for instance
India and China, but I have given them by page or chapter so as to be consulted
with ease.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1241" href="#FNanchor_1241" class="label">[1241]</a> The note of Mommsen, <i>Hermes</i> <span class="allsmcap">XIX</span> 412,
deals with the case of <i>servi quasi coloni</i> farming parcels of
land, recognized in the writings of jurists. It seems that they farmed
either at their own risk or for owner’s account [<i>fide dominica</i>].
In the former case they could have a tenant’s agreement like the free
<i>coloni</i>. In the latter they were only <i>vilici</i> and therefore
part of the <i>instrumentum</i>. Here I think we may see beginnings of
the unfree colonate. But Mommsen does not touch the point of manumission.
It seems to me that an agreement with a slave must at first have been
revocable at the pleasure of the <i>dominus</i>, and its growth into a
binding lease was probably connected in many instances with manumission.</p>

useful and noble. But fresh currents of civilization alter his position.
